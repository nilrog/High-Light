Custom CSS class wrapper
------------------------
Sometimes it is desireable to be able to put certain text parts inside a custom
div-container. So this should be added to High-Light as an extra option. Maybe
as a "Custom" option in the dropdown menu combined with two textfields.

Fetching information from external sources
------------------------------------------
Using some kind of simple but extendable syntax combined with a language markup
the source text should be fetched from outside the RWTextView. Possible sources
are assets added to the current page, external files in the filesystem, remote
URLs from HTTP and maybe FTP, code snippets from online code sources like
snipplr.com etc.

@<<asset:name_of_asset [encoding=utf-8|iso-8851-1]>>
@<<file://path/file [encoding=utf-8|iso-8851-1]>>
@<<http://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/path/file  [encoding=utf-8|iso-8851-1]>>
@<<ftp://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/path/file [encoding=utf-8|iso-8851-1]>>
