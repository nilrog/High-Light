Building the High-Light Plugin
==============================

Just try building the High-Light plugin in Xcode. If that works,
congratulations, you don't need to do a thing!

If that doesn't work, it probably failed because we don't know where the
RWPluginUtilities.framework is. That's a framework that's embedded inside
the RapidWeaver.app bundle, or available for download from Realmac
Softwares website.

* The project expects that the RapidWeaver.app is located in the standard
  application folder. If that is the case you should not need to do
  anything else to be able to compile this project.

The project is already prepared with the "copy" script that will copy the
plugin to the ~/Library/Application Support/RapidWeaver folder so you can
easily test the plugin.

That should be about it. Email me if you're still having problems building
the thing.
