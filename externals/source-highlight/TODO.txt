TODO list
=========

change the _doc, _nodoc, _css so that these definitions are part of only one file, instead
of having different files.

test for always flush (together with line number), and command line option

in style file:
keyword2 like keyword
i.e., default a specific element to another one
if, then, the style is specified, this will override the default one
(possibly in another style file)

use <ol> lists and css for changing colors of lines,
see http://shiflett.org/code/highlight.php

normal = '\\("|\')' generates a failure

tests for .m4 files

shjs_css_transform.sh in share

background color in some .css in doc (for TODO)

the default ctags command line option should contain the
actual found ctags

line-range

CODE CLEANUP

the style file is always parsed even for output formats that don't need it...
but how to infer whether the style must be read or not?
IMPORTANT: this is crucial for output generation such as CSS that produces
elements with the class syntax: if that element is not in the style file that
element will be generated with class normal but this is not really correct...

GROUPS

regexpstatebuilder.H (isn't it a problem for windows?)
yes it might generate problems, try to rename it.

also string def as StringDef

Is there an element class that is not a StateStartLangElem?

If allow for newlines (i.e., read the whole file) then also
split lines when formatting (for instance, for line numbers)
