     anymore.

Version 1.2

   * Added normal text decoration (specify "normal" in tags.j2h) (suggested
     by Bernie Boudet).
   * fixed a bug for multiple input files (notified by Christian Paulsen)

Version 1.1

     Martin Gebert).

     suggested by Robert Wetzel).

Version 1.0

   * This is the first release of source-highlight, but it includes already
     existing programs (cpp2html and java2html), so the changes are related
     to these programs.
   * CGI support enabled (thanks to Robert Wetzel);
     I haven't tested it personally yet, so
     you may ask him directly.
