This is a simple text file;
so basically it doesn't need any special highlighting.

However it is useful to test the default.lang:
this will be basically formatted in the output format,
by replacing special chars of the output format.

For instance, for html: we have &, < and >.

This somehow shows how source-highlight can be used also as
a simple formatter, without highlighting, e.g., to transform
a text file into an HTML file or Tex file, and so on...
