{
 this is just a test for Pascal
 { I'm afraid I don't remember much of Pascal :-)
  so I'll use simple BEGIN END...
  }
 }
Begin
   (* simple hello world! *)
   WRITELN "Hello World";
End

(* Probably it is not even correct :-) *)

(* the IF and VAR inside MYIFVAR must not be highlighted as keyword *)
IF MYIFVAR THEN
   WRITELN "Hello World";
END
