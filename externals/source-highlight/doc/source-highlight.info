1 Introduction
**************

GNU Source-highlight, given a source file, produces a document with
syntax highlighting.  The colors and the styles can be specified (bold,
italics, underline) by means of a configuration file, and some other
options can be specified at the command line.

   The program already recognizes many programming languages (e.g., C++,
Java, Perl, etc.) and file formats (e.g., log files, ChangeLog, etc.),
and some output formats (e.g., HTML, ANSI color escape sequences,
LaTeX, etc.).  Since version 2.0, it allows you to specify your own
input source language via a simple syntax described later in this manual
(*Note Language Definitions::).  Since version 2.1,  it allows you to
specify your own output format language via a simple syntax described
later in this manual (*Note Output Language Definitions::).  Since
version 2.2, it is able to generate cross references (e.g., to variable
names, field names, etc.) by relying on the program _ctags_,
`http://ctags.sourceforge.net' (*Note Generating References::).

     xhtmltable = xhtmltable.outlang

The meaning of the suffixes `-doc', `-css' and `-css-doc' is explained
in *Note Output Language map::.

   Please, keep in mind, that I haven't tested personally all these
language definitions: I actually checked that the definition files are
syntactically correct (with the command line option `--check-lang',
*Note Invoking source-highlight::), but I'm not sure their definition
actually respects that language syntax (e.g., I've put up together some
language definitions by searching for information in the Internet, but
I've never programmed in that language).  So, if you find that a
language definition is not precise, please let me know.  Moreover, if
you have a program example in a language that's not included in the
`tests' directory, please send it to me so that I can include it in the
test suite.

1.2 Using source-highlight as a simple formatter
================================================

You can also use source-highlight as a simple formatter of input file,
i.e., without performing any highlighting(1).

   You can achieve this by using, as the language definition file for
input sources the file `nohilite.lang', using the command line option
`--lang-def' (*Note Invoking source-highlight::).  Since that language
definition is empty, no highlighting will be performed; however,
source-highlight will transform the input file in the output format.
Notice, in the input language associations in *Note Supported
languages::, that `nohilite.lang' is also associated to txt files.

   This, for instance, makes source-highlight useful in cases you want
to transform a text file into HTML or LaTeX.  During the output, in
fact, source-highlight will correctly generate characters that have a
specific meanings in the output format.

   For instance, in this Texinfo manual, if I want to insert a @ or a {
I have to "escape" them to make them appear literally since they have a
special meaning in Texinfo.  The same holds, e.g., for `<', `>' or `&'
in HTML.  If you use source-highlight, it will take care of this,
automatically for you.  This is the Texinfo source of the above
sentence:

     For instance, in this Texinfo manual,
     if I want to insert a @@ or a @{
     I have to ``escape'' them to make them appear literally
     since they have a special meaning in Texinfo.
     The same holds, e.g.,
     for @code{<}, @code{>} or @code{&} in HTML.
     If you use source-highlight,
     it will take care of this, automatically for you.

This was processed by source-highlight as a simple text file, without no
highlighting; however since it was formatted in Texinfo, all the
necessary escaping was automatically performed.  This way, it is very
easy to insert, in the same document, a code, and its result (as in this
example).

   This is actually the formatting performed by source-highlight; except
for the comment, this is basically what you should have written yourself
to do all the escaping stuff manually:

     @c Generator: GNU source-highlight, by Lorenzo Bettini, http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite
     @example
     For instance, in this Texinfo manual,
     if I want to insert a @@@@ or a @@@{
     I have to ``escape'' them to make them appear literally
     since they have a special meaning in Texinfo.
     The same holds, e.g.,
     for @@code@{<@}, @@code@{>@} or @@code@{&@} in HTML.
     If you use source-highlight,
     it will take care of this, automatically for you.
     @end example

   In case source-highlight does not handle a specific input language,
you can still use the option `--failsafe' (*Note Invoking
source-highlight::) and also in that case no highlighting will be
performed, but source-highlight will transform the input file in the
output format.

   Notice, however, that if the input language cannot be established,
the `default.lang' will be used: an empty language definition file
which you might want to customize.

   (1) Although this might have been achieved with previous version, it
is an official supported feature since version 2.5.

1.3 Related Software and Links
==============================

Here we list some software related to source-highlight in the sense that
it uses it as a backend (i.e., provides an interface to
source-highlight) or it uses some of its features (e.g., definition
files):

   * SourceHighlightIDE is a small IDE (for KDE) I wrote for developing
     and debugging new language definitions for source-highlight:

     `http://srchighliteide.sourceforge.net'.

   * Martin Gebert implemented a KDE interface to source-highlight
     programs (and he did a wonderful job!), and it is called
     _Ksrc2highlight_; if you want to test it:

     `http://www.mgebert.de/Ksrc2highlight'.

   * There's also a Java version of java2html, you can find it at

     `http://www.generationjava.com/projects/Java2Html.shtml'.

   * This web site provides a web interface to source-highlight so that
     you can highlight your code on-line:

     `http://www.alaide.com/outils_colorsyntaxe.php'

   * SHJS is a JavaScript program that highlights source code passages
     in HTML documents. Documents using SHJS are highlighted on the
     client side by the web browser.  SHJS uses language definitions
     from Source-highlight.

     `http://shjs.sourceforge.net'

   * Code2blog is a pyGTK front-end to source-highlight for easy
     conversion from source code to HTML.

     `http://code.google.com/p/code2blog'

   * Andy Buckley wrote a wrapper around source-highlight, which can be
     used as an Apache filter to highlight source code in Web pages on
     the fly.

     `http://www.insectnation.org/projects/filter-src-highlight'

   * Roger Nilsson wrote a frontend for source-highlight that is used
     in a popular webdesign app for OSX called RapidWeaver. The
     frontend is called High-Light and allows users to easily add
     syntax-colored code inside RapidWeaver.

2 Installation
**************

See the file `INSTALL' for detailed building and  installation
instructions; anyway if you're used to compiling Linux software that
comes with sources you may simply follow the usual procedure, i.e.,
untar the file you downloaded in a directory and then:

     cd <source code main directory>
     ./configure
     make
     make install

   However, before you do this, please check that you have everything
that is needed to build source-highlight, *Note What you need to build
source-highlight::.

   Note: unless you specify a different install directory by `--prefix'
option of configure (e.g. `./configure --prefix=<your home>'), you must
be root to run `make install'.

   Files will be installed in the following directories:

`Executables'
     `/prefix/bin'

`docs and samples'
     `/prefix/share/doc/source-highlight'

`conf files'
     `/prefix/share/source-highlight'

   Default value for prefix is `/usr/local' but you may change it with
`--prefix' option to configure.

   NOTICE: Originally, instead of Source-highlight, there were  two
separate programs, namely _GNU java2html_ and _GNU cpp2html_.  There
are two shell scripts with the same name that will be installed
together with Source-highlight in order to facilitate the migration
(however their use is not advised and it is deprecated).

File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Download,  Next: Anonymous CVS Access,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Installation

2.1 Download
============

You can download it from GNU's ftp site:
`ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/src-highlite' or from one of its mirrors (see
`http://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.html').

   I do not distribute Windows binaries anymore; since, they can be
easily built by using Cygnus C/C++ compiler, available at
`http://www.cygwin.com'.  However, if you don't feel like downloading
such compiler, you can request such binaries directly to me, by e-mail
(find my e-mail at my home page) and I can send them to you.  An
MS-Windows port of Source-highlight is available from
`http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net'.

   Archives are digitally signed by me (Lorenzo Bettini) with GNU gpg
(`http://www.gnupg.org'). My GPG public key can be found at my home
page (`http://www.lorenzobettini.it').

   You can also get the patches, if they are available for a particular
release (see below for patching from a previous version).


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Anonymous CVS Access,  Next: What you need to build source-highlight,  Prev: Download,  Up: Installation

2.2 Anonymous CVS Access
========================

This project's CVS repository can be checked out through anonymous
(pserver) CVS with the following instruction:

     cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/src-highlite co src-highlite

   Further instructions can be found at the address:

   `http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/src-highlite'.

   Please notice that this way you will get the latest development
sources of Source-highlight, which may also be unstable.  This solution
is the best if you intend to correct/extend this program: you should
send me patches against the latest cvs repository sources.

   If, on the contrary, you want to get the sources of a given release,
through cvs, say, e.g., version X.Y.Z, you must specify the tag
`rel_X_Y_Z' when you run the cvs command or the `cvs update' command.

   NOTICE: This convention holds since release 2.1.

   When you compile the sources that you get through the cvs repository,
before running the `configure' and `make' commands, you should, at
least the first time, run the command:

     sh autogen.sh

This will run the autotools commands in the correct order, and also copy
possibly missing files.  You should have installed recent versions of `automake',
`autoconf' and `libtool' in order for this to succeed.  You will also
need `flex' and `bison'.


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: What you need to build source-highlight,  Next: Tips on installing Boost Regex library,  Prev: Anonymous CVS Access,  Up: Installation

2.3 What you need to build source-highlight
===========================================

Since version 2.0 Source-highlight relies on regular expressions as
provided by boost (`http://www.boost.org'), so you need to install at
least the regex library from boost.

   Most GNU/Linux distributions provide this library already in a
compiled form.  If you use your distribution packages, please be sure
to install also the development package of the boost libraries.

   If you experience problems in installing Boost Regex library, or in
compiling source-highlight because of this library, please take a look
at *Note Tips on installing Boost Regex library::.

   If you want to use a specific version of the Boost regex library
(because you have many versions of it), you can use the configure option
`--with-boost-regex' to specify a particular suffix.  For instance,

     ./configure --with-boost-regex=boost_regex-gcc-1_31

   Source-highlight has been developed under GNU/Linux, using gcc (C++),
and bison (yacc) and flex (lex), and ported under Win32 with Cygnus
C/C++compiler, available at `http://www.cygwin.com'.

   I use the excellent GNU Autoconf(1), GNU Automake(2) and GNU
Libtool(3).  Since version 2.6 I also started to use Gnulib - The GNU
Portability Library(4), "a central location for common GNU code,
intended to be shared among GNU packages" (for instance, I rely on
Gnulib for checking for the presence and correctness of `getopt_long'
function).

   Finally I used _GNU gengetopt_
(`http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt'), for command line parsing.

   I started to use also _doublecpp_
(`http://doublecpp.sourceforge.net') that permits achieving dynamic
overloading.

   Actually, apart from the boost regex library, you don't need the
other tools above to build source-highlight (indeed I provide the output
sources generated by the above mentioned tools), unless you want to
develop source-highlight.

   However, if you obtained sources through CVS, you need some other
tools, see *Note Anonymous CVS Access::.

2.4 Tips on installing Boost Regex library
==========================================

I created this section because many users reported some problems after
installing Boost Regex library from sources; other users had problems in
compiling source-highlight even if this library was already correctly
installed (especially windows users, using cygwin).  I hope this section
sheds some light in installing/using the Boost Regex library.  Please,
notice that this section does not explain how to compile the Boost
libraries (the documentation you'll find on `http://www.boost.org' is
well done); it explains how to tweak things if you have problems in
compiling source-highlight even after a successful installation of Boost
libraries.

   If you experience no problem in compiling source-highlight, you can
happily skip this section :-)

   First of all, if your distribution provides packages for the Boost
regex library, please be sure to install also the development package
of the boost libraries, i.e., those providing also the header files
needed to compile a program using these libraries.  For instance, on my
Debian system I had to install the package `libboost-regex-dev', besides
the package `libboost-regex'.

   If your distribution does not provide these packages then you have to
download the sources of Boost libraries from `http://www.boost.org' and
follow the instructions for compilation and installation.  However, I
suggest you specify `/usr' as prefix for installation, instead of
relying on the default prefix `/usr/local' (unless `/usr/local/include'
is already in the inclusion path of your C++ compiler), since this will
make things easier when compiling source-highlight.  I suggest this,
since `/usr/include' is usually the place where C++ searches for header
files during compilation.

   If you successfully compiled and installed the Boost Regex library,
or you installed the package from your distribution, but you STILL
experience problems in compiling source-highlight, then you simply have
to adjust some things as described in the following.

   If the `./configure' command of source-highlight reports this error:

     ERROR! Boost::regex library not installed.

then, the compiler cannot find the header files for this library.  In
this case, check that the directory `/usr/include/boost' actually
exists; if it does not, then probably you'll find a similar directory,
e.g., `/usr/include/boost-1_33/boost', depending on the version of the
library you have installed.  Then, all you have to do is to create a
symbolic link as follows:

     ln -s /usr/include/boost-1_33/boost /usr/include/boost

Alternatively, you might run source-highlight's configure as follows:

     ./configure CXXFLAGS=-I/usr/include/boost-1_33/

   If then `./configure' command of source-highlight reports this other
error:

     ERROR! Boost::regex library is installed, but you
     must specify the suffix with --with-boost-regex at configure
     for instance, --with-boost-regex=boost_regex-gcc-1_31

then, there's still another thing to fix: you must find out the exact
names of the files of your installed Boost Regex libraries; you can do
this by using the command:

     $ ls -l /usr/lib/libboost_regex*

that, for instance, on one of my cygwin installation reports:

     -rwxr-x---+ Nov  9 23:29 /usr/lib/libboost_regex-gcc-mt-s-1_33.a
     -rwxr-x---+ Nov 22 09:22 /usr/lib/libboost_regex-gcc-mt-s.a
     -rwxr-x---+ Nov  9 23:29 /usr/lib/libboost_regex-gcc-mt-s-1_33.so
     -rwxr-x---+ Nov 22 09:22 /usr/lib/libboost_regex-gcc-mt-s.so

Now, you have all the information to correctly run the
source-highlight's configure command:

     ./configure --with-boost-regex=boost_regex-gcc-mt-s-1_33

or, if you solved the first problem in the second way(1),

     ./configure CXXFLAGS=-I/usr/include/boost-1_33/ \
                 --with-boost-regex=boost_regex-gcc-mt-s-1_33

   Of course, you have to modify this command according to the names of
your Boost Regex library installed files.

   These instructions managed to let many users, who were experiencing
problems, to compile source-highlight If you still have problems, please
send me an e-mail.

2.5 Patching from a previous version
====================================

If you downloaded a patch, say `source-highlight-1.3-1.3.1-patch.gz'
(i.e., the patch to go from version 1.3 to version 1.3.1), cd to the
directory with sources from the previous version (source-highlight-1.3)
and type:

     gunzip -cd ../source-highlight-1.3-1.3.1.patch.gz | patch -p1

   and restart the compilation process (if you had already run
configure a simple make should do).

2.6 Using source-highlight with less
====================================

This was suggested by Konstantine Serebriany.   The script
`src-hilite-lesspipe.sh' will be installed together with
source-highlight.  You can use the following environment variables:

     export LESSOPEN="| /path/to/src-hilite-lesspipe.sh %s"
     export LESS=' -R '

   This way, when you use less to browse a file, if it is a source file
handled by source-highlight, it will be automatically highlighted.

2.7 Using source-highlight as a CGI
===================================

CGI support was enabled thanks to Robert Wetzel; I haven't tested it
personally.  If you want to use source-highlight as a CGI program, you
have to use the executable source-highlight-cgi.  You can build such
executable by issuing

     make source-highlight-cgi

in the `src' directory.

2.8 Building .rpm
=================

Christian W. Zuckschwerdt added support for building an .rpm and an
.rpm.src.  You can issue the following command

     rpm -tb source-highlight-2.8.tar.gz

   for building an .rpm with binaries and

     rpm -ts source-highlight-2.8.tar.gz

   for building an .rpm.src with sources.

4 Simple Usage
**************

Here are some realistic examples of running `source-highlight'(1).

   Source-highlight only does a lexical analysis of the source code, so
the program source is assumed to be correct!

   Here's how to run source-highlight (for this example we will use
C/C++ input files, but this is valid also for other source-highlight
input languages):

     source-highlight --src-lang cpp --out-format html \
         --input <C++ FILE> \
         --output <HTML FILE> \
         --style-file <STYLE FILE> \
         OPTIONS

   For input files, apart from the `-i (--input)' option and the
standard input redirection, you can simply specify some files at the
command line and also use regular expressions (for instance `*.java').
In this case the name for the output files will be formed using the
name of the source file with a .<ext> appended, where <ext> is the
extension chosen according to the output format specified (in this
example it would be .html).  The style file (*Note Output format
style::) contains information on how to format specific language parts
(e.g., keywords in blue and boldface, etc.).

   If `STDOUT' string is passed as `-o (--output)' option, then the
output is forced to the standard output anyway.

   If `-s (--src-lang)' is not specified, the source language is
inferred by the extension of the input file (this, of course, does not
work with standard input redirection).  For further details, see *Note
How the input language is discovered::.

   If `-f (--out-format)' is not specified, the output will be produced
in HTML.

   If `--style-file' is not specified, the `default.style', which is
included in the distribution, will be used (see *Note Output format
style:: for further information).

one line only, anyway.


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: HTML and XHTML output,  Next: LaTeX output,  Prev: Simple Usage,  Up: Simple Usage

4.1 HTML and XHTML output
=========================

The default output format for HTML and XHTML uses fixed width fonts by
inserting all the formatted output between `<tt>' and `</tt>'.  Thus,
for instance, specification for fixed width and not fixed width (see
*Note Output format style::) will have no effect: every character will
have fixed width.  If you don't like this default behavior and would
like to have not fixed fonts by default (as it happens, e.g., with
LaTeX output) you can use the file `html_notfixed.outlang' with the
command line argument `--outlang-def'.  For XHTML output, the
corresponding file is `xhtml_notfixed.outlang'

   Furthermore, the file `htmltable.outlang' can be used to generate
HTML output enclosed in an HTML table (which will use also a background
color if specified in the style file).   The file `xhtmltable.outlang'
does the same but for XHTML output.

4.2 LaTeX output
================

When using LaTeX output format you can choose between monochromatic
output (by using `-f latex') or colored output (by using `-f
latexcolor').  When using colored output, you need the `color' package
(again this should be present in your system).  Of course, you are free
to define your own LaTeX output format, see *Note Output Language
Definitions::.


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Texinfo output,  Next: DocBook output,  Prev: LaTeX output,  Up: Simple Usage

4.3 Texinfo output
==================

When using the Texinfo output format, you may want to use a dedicated
style file, `texinfo.style', which comes with the source-highlight
distribution, with the option `--style-file'.  For instance, the
example in *Note Examples:: is formatted with this style file.


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: DocBook output,  Next: ANSI color escape sequences,  Prev: Texinfo output,  Up: Simple Usage

4.4 DocBook output
==================

DocBook output is generated using the `<programlisting>' tag.  If the
`--doc' command line option is given, an `<article>' document is
generated.


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: ANSI color escape sequences,  Prev: DocBook output,  Up: Simple Usage

4.5 ANSI color escape sequences
===============================

If you're using this output format, for instance together with `less'
(see *Note Using source-highlight with less::), you may want to use the
`esc.style', which comes with the source-highlight distribution, with
the option `--style-file'.  This should result in a more pleasant
coloring output.


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Configuration files,  Next: Invoking source-highlight,  Prev: Simple Usage,  Up: Top

5 Configuration files
*********************

During execution, source-highlight needs some files where it finds
directives on how to recognize the source language (if not  specified
explicitly with `--src-lang' or `--lang-def'), on which output format
to use (if not specified explicitly with `--out-format' or
`--outlang-def'), on how to format specific source elements (e.g.,
keywords, comments, etc.), and source and output language definitions.
These files will be explained in the next sections.

   If the directory for such files is not explicitly specified with the
command line option `--data-dir', these files are searched for in the
following order:

   * the current directory;

   * the installation directory for conf files, see *Note Installation::
     (please keep in mind that this directory is hard-coded into
     source-highlight during compilation).

   * if the source-highlight command is specified with an explicit path
     name, the installation directory name is still used, but relative
     to the explicit path name.

   If you want to be sure about which file is used during the
execution, you can use the command line option `--verbose'.

5.1 Output format style
=======================

You must specify your options for syntax highlighting in the file
`default.style'(1).  You can specify formatting options for each
element defined by a language definition file (you can get the list of
such elements, by using `--show-lang-elements', see *Note Listing
Language Elements::).

   Since version 2.6, you can also specify the background color for the
output document, using the keyword `bgcolor' (this might be visible
only when the `--doc' command line option is used).

   If many elements share the same formatting options, you can specify
these elements in the same line, separated by a comma(2).

   Here's the `default.style' that comes with this distribution (this
is formatted by using the `style.lang' that is shown in *Note Tutorials
on Language Definitions::):

     bgcolor "white"; // the background color for documents

     keyword blue b ; // for language keywords
     type darkgreen ; // for basic types
     string red f ; // for strings and chars
     regexp orange f ; // for strings and chars
     specialchar pink f ; // for special chars, e.g., \n, \t, \\
     comment brown i, noref; // for comments
     number purple ;       // for literal numbers
     preproc darkblue b ; // for preproc directives (e.g. #include, import)
     symbol darkred ; // for simbols (e.g. <, >, +)
     function black b; // for function calls and declarations
     cbracket red; // for block brackets (e.g. {, })
     todo bg:cyan b;       // for TODO and FIXME

     // line numbers
     linenum black f;

     // Internet related
     url blue u, f;

     // other elements for ChangeLog and Log files
     date blue b ;
     time, file darkblue b ;
     ip, name darkgreen ;

     // for Prolog, Perl...
     variable darkgreen ;

     // explicit for Latex
     italics darkgreen i;
     bold darkgreen b;
     underline darkgreen u;
     fixed green f;
     argument darkgreen;
     optionalargument purple;
     math orange;
     bibtex blue;

     // for diffs
     oldfile orange;
     newfile darkgreen;
     difflines blue;

     // for css
     selector purple;
     property blue;
     value darkgreen i;

   This file tries to define a style for most elements defined in the
language definition files that comes with Source-highlight distribution.

   You can specify your own file (it doesn't have to be named
`default.style') with the command line option `--style-file'(3), see
*Note Invoking source-highlight::.

   You can also specify the color of normal text by adding this line

     normal darkblue ;

   As you might see the syntax of this file is quite straightforward:
after the element (or elements, separated by commas) you can specify the
color, and the background color(4) by using the prefix `bg:' (for
instance, in the `default.style' above the background color is
specified for the `todo' element).

   Notice that the background color might not be available for all ouput
formats: it is available for XHTML and LaTeX but not for HTML(5).

   Then, you can specify further formatting options such as bold,
italics, etc.; these are the keywords that can be used:

     b = bold
     i = italics
     u = underline
     f = fixed
     nf = not fixed
     noref = no reference information is generated for these elements

   Since version 2.2, the color specification is not required.  For
instance, the `texinfo.style' is as follows (we avoid colors for
Texinfo outputs):

     keyword, type b ;
     variable f, i ;
     string f ;
     regexp f ;
     comment nf, i, noref ;
     preproc b ;

     // line numbers
     linenum f;

     // Internet related
     url f;

     // for diffs
     oldfile, newfile i;
     difflines b;

     // for css
     selector, property b;
     value i;

   You may also specify more than on of these options separated by
commas, e.g.

     keyword blue u, b ;

Please keep in mind that in this case the order of these specified
options is kept during the generation of the output; for instance,
depending on the specific output format, the sequences `u, b' and `b,
u' may lead to different results.  In particular, the style that comes
first is used after the ones that follow.  For instance, in the case of
HTML, the sequence `u, b' will lead to the following formatting:
`<u><b>...</b></u>'.

   The `noref' option specifies that for this element reference
information are not generated (see *Note Generating References::).  For
instance, this is used for the `comment' element, since we do not want
that elements in a comment are searched for cross-references.

   These are all possible color logical names handled by
source-highlight(6):

     black
     red
     darkred
     brown
     yellow
     cyan
     blue
     pink
     purple
     orange
     brightorange
     green
     brightgreen
     darkgreen
     teal
     gray
     darkblue

   You can also use the direct color scheme for the specific output
format, by using double quotes, such as, e.g., `"#00FF00"' in HTML(7)
or even string colors in double quotes(8), such as `"lightblue"'.  Of
course, the double quotes will be discarded during the generation.

   For instance, this is the `syslog.style' used in the `tests'
directory.  This uses direct color schemes.

     date, keyword yellow b ;
     time "#9999FF" ;
     ip "lightblue" b ;

     type cyan b ;
     string "brown" b ;
     comment teal ;
     number red ;
     preproc cyan ;
     symbol green ;
     function "#CC66CC" b ;
     cbracket green b ;
     twonumbers green b ;
     port green b ;
     webmethod teal ;

     // foo option
     foo red b ; // foo entry

   Notice that, if you use direct color schemes, source-highlight will
perform no transformation, and will output exactly the color scheme you
specified.  For instance, the specification `"brown"' is different from
`brown': the former will be output as it is, while the latter will be
translated in the corresponding color of the output format (for HTML
the visible result is likely to be the same).

   It is up to you to specify a color scheme string that is handled by
the specific output format.  Thus, direct color schemes might not be
portable in different output formats; for instance, `"#00FF00"' is
valid in HTML but not in LaTeX.

File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Output format style using CSS,  Next: Language map,  Prev: Output format style,  Up: Configuration files

5.2 Output format style using CSS
=================================

Since version 2.6 you can specify the output format style also using a
limited CSS syntax.  Please, notice that this has nothing to do with
output produced by source-highlight using the `--css' option.

   By using a CSS file as the style file (i.e., passing it to the
`--style-css-file' command line option) you will only specify the
output format style using the same syntax of CSS.  This means that you
can use a css syntax for specifying the output format style
independently from the actual output (this is what the output format
style is for).  Thus, you can use a css file as the output format style
also for LaTeX output (just like you would do with a source-hihglight
output format style, *Note Output format style::).

   This feature is provided basically for code re-use: you can specify
the output format style using a css file, and then re-use the same css
file as the actual style sheet of other HTML pages (or even output files
produced by source-highlight using the `--css' option).

   Notice that this feature is quite primordial, so only a limited
subset of CSS syntax is recognized.  In particular, selectors are always
intended as CSS class selectors, so they must start with a dot.  `/*
*/' comments are handled.  Properties (and their values) not handled by
source-highlight are simply (and silently) discarded).

   This is an example of CSS specification handled correctly by
source-highlight as a style format specification:

     body {
       background-color: <color specification>;
      }

     .selector {
       color: <color specification>;
       background-color: <color specification>;
       font-weight: bold; /* this is a comment */
       font-family: monospace;
       font-style: italic;
       text-decoration: underline;
      }

   Finally, this is the `default.css' that corresponds to
`default.style' presented in *Note Output format style:::

     body {  background-color: white;  }

     .keyword { color: blue; font-weight: bold; }
     .type { color: darkgreen; }
     .string { color: red; font-family: monospace; }
     .regexp { color: orange; }
     .specialchar { color: pink; font-family: monospace; }
     .comment { color: brown; font-style: italic; }
     .number { color: purple; }
     .preproc { color: darkblue; font-weight: bold; }
     .symbol { color: darkred; }
     .function { color: black; font-weight: bold; }
     .cbracket { color: red; }
     .todo { font-weight: bold; background-color: cyan; }

     /* line numbers */
     .linenum { color: black; font-family: monospace; }

     /* Internet related */
     .url { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; font-family: monospace; }

     /* other elements for ChangeLog and Log files */
     .date { color: blue; font-weight: bold; }
     .time, .file { color: darkblue; font-weight: bold; }
     .ip, .name { color: darkgreen; }

     /* for Prolog, Perl */
     .variable { color: darkgreen; }
     .italics { color: darkgreen; font-style: italic; }
     .bold { color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold; }

     /* for LaTeX */
     .underline { color: darkgreen; text-decoration: underline; }
     .fixed { color: green; font-family: monospace; }
     .argument, .optionalargument { color: darkgreen; }
     .math { color: orange; }
     .bibtex { color: blue; }

     /* for diffs */
     .oldfile { color: orange; }
     .newfile { color: darkgreen; }
     .difflines { color: blue; }

     /* for css */
     .selector { color: purple; }
     .property { color: blue; }
     .value { color: darkgreen; font-style: italic; }

   If you pass this file to the `--style-css-file' command line option
and you produce an output file, you will get the same result of using
`default.style'.

   Source-highlight comes with a lot of CSS files that can be used
either as standard CSS files for HTML documents, or as style files to
pass to `--style-css-file'.  In the documentation installation directory
(see *Note Installation::) you will find the file `style_examples.html'
which shows many output examples, each one with a different CSS style.

5.3 Language map
================

This configuration file associates a file extension to a specific
language definition file.  You can also use such file extension to
specify the `--src-lang' option (see *Note Simple Usage::).
Source-highlight comes with such a file, called `lang.map'.

   Of course, you can override the settings of this file by writing
your own language map file and specify such file with the command line
option `--lang-map').  Moreover, as explained above, if a file
`lang.map' is present in the current directory, such version will be
used.  The format of such file is quite simple:

     extension = language definition file

   The default language definition file is shown in *Note
Introduction::.

5.4 Language definition files
=============================

These files are crucial for source-highlight since they specify the
source elements that have to be highlighted.   These files also allow to
specify your own language definitions in order to deal with a language
that is not handled by source-highlight(1).  The syntax for these files
is explained in *Note Language Definitions::.

respect the previous version.


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Output Language map,  Next: Output Language definition files,  Prev: Language definition files,  Up: Configuration files

5.5 Output Language map
=======================

This configuration file associates an output format to a specific output
language definition file.  You can use the name of that output format to
specify the `--out-format' option (see *Note Simple Usage::).
Source-highlight comes with such a file, called `outlang.map'.

   Of course, you can override the settings of this file by writing
your own output language map file and specify such file with the
command line option `--outlang-map').  Moreover, as explained above, if
a file `outlang.map' is present in the current directory, such version
will be used.  The format of such file is quite simple:

     output format name = language definition file

   The default language definition file is shown in *Note
Introduction::.

   In particular, there is a convention for the output format name in
the output language map, according to the suffix of the name with a
dash `-':

`-doc'
     The one used when `--doc' command line option is given

`-css-doc'
     The one used when `--css' command line option is given

`-css'
     The one used when `--css' and `--no-doc' command line options  are
     given

   If a combination of the above mentioned command line options is given
for a specific output format, and a corresponding definition file is not
specified in the map file, then an error is raised.

   For instance, if you specified the definition file for your language
`mylang' and also one for dealing with `--doc' option, i.e., a
definition file for `mylang-doc', and you run source-highlight as
follows:

   `source-highlight -f mylang --css mycss.css'

You will get the following error:

   `source-highlight: output language mylang-css-doc not handled'

                                       corresponding to a language definition file

   Let us explain some options in details (apart from those that should
be clear from the `--help' output itself, and those already explained
in *Note Simple Usage::).

`--doc'
`-d'
     If you want a stand alone output document (i.e., an output file
     that is not thought to be included in another document), specify
     this option (otherwise you just get some text that you can paste
     into another document).  If you choose this option and do not
     provide a `--title', the your source file name will be used as the
     title.

`--no-doc'
     The `--doc' option above is actually implied by other command line
     options (e.g., `--css').  If you do not want this (e.g., you want
     to include the output in an existing document containing the global
     style sheet), you can disable this by using `--no-doc'.

`--css'
`-c'
     Specify the style sheet file (e.g., a `.css' for HTML(1)) for the
     output document.  Notice that source-highlight will not use this
     file: it will simply use this file name when generating the output
     file, so to specify that the output file uses this file as the
     style sheet (e.g., if the generated HTML relies on this file as
     the CSS file).

`--tab'
`-t'
     With this options, tab characters will be converted into specified
     number of space characters (tabulation points will be preserved).
     This option is automatically selected when generating line numbers.

`--style-file'
`--style-css-file'
     Specify the file that source-highlight will use to produce (i.e.,
     format) the output (e.g., colors and other styles for each
     language element).  The formats of these files are detailed in
     *Note Output format style:: and in *Note Output format style using
     CSS::, respectively.

`--output-dir'
     You can pass to source-highlight more than one input file (see
     *Note Simple Usage::).  In this case you cannot specify the output
     file name.  In such cases the output files will be automatically
     generated into the directory where you invoked the command from;
     if you want the output files to be generated into a different
     directory you can use this option.

`--infer-lang'
     Force the inference mechanism for detecting the input language.
     This is detailed in *Note How the input language is discovered::.

`--line-number'
     Line numbers will be generated in the output, using the (optional)
     specified padding character(2) (the default padding character is
     `0').

`--line-number-ref'
     As `--line-number', this option numbers all the output lines, and,
     additionally, generates an anchor for each line.  The anchor
     consists of the specified prefix (default is `line') and the line
     number (e.g., `line25').  For instance, as prefix, if you deal
     with many files, you can use the file name.  Notice that some
     output languages might not support this feature (e.g., `esc',
     since it makes no sense in such case).  See *Note Anchors and
     References:: for defining how to generate an anchor in a specific
     output language.

`--failsafe'
     If no language specification is found, an error will be printed
     and the program exits.  With this option, instead, in such
     situations, the input is simply formatted in the output format.
     This is useful when `source-highlight' is used with many input
     files, and it is also used in the `src-hilite-lesspipe.sh' script.
     Actually I failed to find a good reason why one should not always
     use this option.  So my suggestion is to always use it when you
     run source-highlight (and indeed, in the future, this option might
     become the default one).  See also *Note Using source-highlight
     with less::, *Note Using source-highlight as a simple formatter::.

     When using `--failsafe', if no input language can be established,
     source-highlight will use the input language definition file
     `default.lang', which is an empty file.  You might want to
     customize such file, though.

`--debug-lang'

`--show-regex'
     Allows to debug a language definition file, *Note Debugging::.


   The other command line options dealing with references are explained
in more details in *Note Generating References::.

6.1 How the input language is discovered
========================================

As already explained, *Note Simple Usage::, source-highlight uses a
language definition file according the language specified with the
option `--src-lang', or `--lang-def', or by using the input file
extension.

   Since version 2.5, source-highlight can use an inference mechanism to
deduce the input language.  For the moment, it can detect script
languages based on the "sha-bang" mechanism, i.e., when the first line
of a script contains a line such as, e.g.,

     #!/bin/sh

   It also detects script languages specified by using the `env'
program(1):

     #!/usr/bin/env perl

   Finally, it also recognizes the Emacs convention, of declaring the
Emacs major mode using the format `-*- lang -*-'.

   For instance, a script starting as the following one:

     #!/bin/bash
     # -*- Tcl -*-

will be interpreted as a Tcl script, and not as bash script.

   This inference mechanism is performed, by default, in case the input
language is neither explicitly specified nor found in the language map
file by using the input file extension (the input file may also have no
extension at all).

   Furthermore, this mechanism can be given priority with the command
line option `--infer-lang'.  For instance, this is used in the script
`src-hilite-lesspipe.sh' (*Note Using source-highlight with less::)
when running source-highlight, in order to avoid the problem of
formatting a Perl script as a Prolog program (since the extension `.pl'
is associated to Prolog programs in the language map file).

7 Language Definitions
**********************

Since version 2.0 source-highlight uses a specific syntax to specify
source language elements (e.g., keywords, strings, comments, etc.).
Before version 2.0, language elements were scanned through Flex.  This
had the drawback of writing a new flex file to deal with a new
language; even worse, a new language could not be added "dynamically":
you had to recompile the whole source-highlight program.

   Instead, now, language elements are specified in a file, loaded
dynamically, through a (hopefully) simple syntax.  Then, these
definitions are used internally to create, on-the-fly, regular
expressions that are used to highlight the elements.  In particular, we
use the regular expressions provided by the Boost library (see *Note
Installation::).   Thus, when writing a language definition file you
will surely have to deal with regular expressions.  Of course, we use
the Boost regex library regular expression syntax.  We refer to Boost
documentation for such syntax,
`http://www.boost.org/libs/regex/doc/syntax.html', however, in *Note
Notes on regular expressions::, we provide some notes on regular
expressions that might be helpful for those who never dealt with them.
By default, Boost regex library uses Perl regular expression syntax,
and, at the moment, this is the only syntax supported by
source-highlight.

   Here, we see such syntax in details, by relying on many examples.
This allows a user to easily modify an existing language definition and
create a new one.  These files have, typically, extension `.lang'.

   Each definition basically associates a regular expression to a
language element and defines a name for the language element.  Such
name will be used to associate a particular style (e.g., bold face,
color, etc.) when highlighting of such elements.  You cannot use names
that are the same of keywords used in the language definition syntax
(e.g., `start', as shown later, is a reserved word).

   Comments can be given by using `#'; the rest of the line is
considered as a comment.

   Source-highlight will scan each line of the input file separately.
So a regular expression that tries to match new line characters is
destined to fail.  However, the language definition syntax provides
means to deal with multiple lines (see *Note Delimited definitions:: and
*Note State/Environment Definitions::).

7.1 Ways of specifying regular expressions
==========================================

Before getting into details of language definition syntax, it is crucial
to describe the 3 possible ways of specifying a regular expression
string.  These 3 different ways, basically differ in the way they handle
regular expression special characters, such, e.g., parenthesis.  For
this reason, one mechanism can be more powerful than another one, but it
could also require more attention; furthermore, there can be situations
where you're forced to use only one mechanism, since the other ones
cannot accomplish the required goal.

`"expression"'
     If you use double quotes (notice, `"' and not ```' or `''') to
     specify a regular expression, then basically all the characters,
     but the alternation symbol, i.e., the pipe symbol `|', are
     considered literally, and thus will be automatically escaped (e.g.,
     a dot `.' is interpreted as the character `.' not as the regular
     expression wild card).  Thus, for instance, if you specify

          "my(regular)ex.pre$$ion{*}"

     source-highlight will automatically transform it into

          my\(regular\)ex\.pre\$\$ion\{\*\}

     The special character `|', unless it is meant to separate two
     alternatives (*Note Simple definitions::), must be escaped with the
     character `\', e.g., `\|'.  Also the character `\', if it is
     intended literally, must be escaped, e.g., `\\'.

`'expression''
     If you want to enjoy the full power of regular expressions, you
     need to use single quoted strings (`''), instead of double quoted
     strings.  This way, you can specify special characters with their
     intended meaning.

     However, marked subexpressions are automatically transformed in non
     marked subexpressions, i.e., the parts in the expression of the
     shape `(...)' will be transformed into `(?:...)'  (as explained in
     *Note Notes on regular expressions::, `(?:...)'  lexically groups
     part of a regular expression, without generating a marked
     sub-expression).

     Thus, for instance, if you specify

          'my(regular)ex.pre$ion*'

     source-highlight will automatically transform it into

          my(?:regular)ex.pre$ion*

     Since marked subexpressions cannot be specified with this syntax,
     then _backreferences_ (see *Note Notes on regular expressions::)
     are not allowed.

``expression`'
     This syntax(1) (notice the difference, this one uses the
     _backtick_ ``' while the previous one uses `'') for specifying a
     regular expression was introduced to overcome the limitations of
     the other two syntaxes.  With this syntax, the marked
     subexpressions are not transformed, and so you can use regular
     expressions mechanisms that rely on marked subexpressions, such as
     _backreferences_ and _conditionals_ (see *Note Notes on regular
     expressions::).

     This syntax is also crucial for highlighting specific program
     parts of some programming languages, such as, e.g., Perl regular
     expressions (e.g., in substitution expressions) that can be
     expressed in many forms, in particular, separators for the part to
     be replaced and the part to replace with can be any non
     alphanumerical characters(2), for instance,

          s/foo/bar/g
          s|foo|bar|g
          s#foo#bar#g
          s@foo@bar@g

     Using this syntax, and backreferences, we can easily define a
     single language element to deal with these expressions (without
     specify all the cases for each possible non alphanumerical
     character):

          regexp = `s([^[:alnum:][:blank:]]).*\1.*\1[ixsmogce]*`


   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Since version 2.7.

   (2) This issue concerning Perl regular expression syntax was raised
by Elias Pipping, and this also pushed me to deal with this more
powerful syntax that permits using backreferences, for instance.
Although we're still far from highlighting Perl syntax completely, I
definitely must thank Elias for his precious information about this
matter :-)


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Simple definitions,  Next: Line wide definitions,  Prev: Ways of specifying regular expressions,  Up: Language Definitions

7.2 Simple definitions
======================

The simplest way of specify language elements is to list the possible
alternatives.  This is the case, for instance, for keywords.  For
instance, in `java.lang' you have:

     keyword = "abstract|assert|break|case|catch|class|const",
               "continue|default|do|else|extends|false|final",
               "finally|for|goto|if|implements|instanceof|interface"
     keyword = "native|new|null|private|protected|public|return",
               "static|strictfp|super|switch|synchronized|throw",
               "throws|true|this|transient|try|volatile|while"

   You can separate quoted definitions with commas.  Alternatively,
within a quoted definition, alternatives can be separated with the pipe
symbol `|'.  The above definition defines the language element
`keyword'.  Each time an element is found in the source file, it is
highlighted with the style for the element with the same name in the
output format style file (notice that all elements shown in the example
are take from the language definition files that come with
source-highlight and there is a style for each of such elements, see
*Note Configuration files::).  If such an element is not specified in
the output format style file, it is simply not highlighted (actually,
it is highlighted with style `normal', *Note Configuration files::) (so
pay attention to typos :-).

   From the above example you may have noticed that language element
definitions are cumulative, so the second `keyword' definition does not
replace the first one.   (Indeed, in some cases you may want to
actually redefine a language element; this is possible as explained in
*Note Redefinitions and Substitutions::).

   Notice that words specified in double quotes have to match exactly
in a source file, and they must be isolated (not surrounded by anything
but spaces).  Thus for instance `class' is matched as a keyword, but in
`my_class' the substring `class' is not matched as keyword.  From the
point of view of regular expressions a string such as `class' in a
double quote simple definition is intended as `\<(class)\>'.

   Special characters have to be escaped with the character `\'.  So
for instance if you want to specify the character `|', which is
normally used to separate alternatives in double quoted strings, you
have to specify `\|'.

   As explained in *Note Ways of specifying regular expressions::,
definitions in double quotes are interpreted literally (thus, e.g., a
dot `.' is interpreted as the character `.' not as the regular
expression wild card).   If you want to enjoy the full power of regular
expressions to specify a language alternative, you have to use single
quoted strings (`''), instead of double quoted strings.

   For instance, the following is the definition for a preprocessor
directive in C/C++:

     preproc = '^[[:blank:]]*#([[:blank:]]*[[:word:]]*)'

   Notice that the definition `'class'' is different from `"class"', as
explained above.  Thus, for instance `'class'' matches also the
sub-expression `class' inside `my_class'.

   Finally, at the end of a list of definitions, one can specify the
keyword `nonsensitive'; in that case, the specified strings will be
interpreted in a non case sensitive way.  For instance, we use this
feature in Pascal language definition, `pascal.lang' where keywords are
parsed in a non sensitive way:

     keyword = "alfa|and|array|begin|case|const|div",
           "do|downto|else|end|false|file|for|function|get|goto|if|in",
           "label|mod|new|not|of|or|pack|packed|page|program",
           "put|procedure|read|readln|record|repeat|reset|rewrite|set",
           "text|then|to|true|type|unpack|until|var|while|with|writeln|write"
       nonsensitive

7.3 Line wide definitions
=========================

It is often useful to define a language element that affects all the
remaining characters up to the end of the line.   For such definitions,
instead of the `=' you must use the keyword `start'.   For instance,
the following is the definition of a single line comment in C++:

     comment start "//"

   This says that when the two characters `//' are encountered in the
source file, everything from these characters, include, up to the end of
the line, will be highlighted according to the style `comment'.


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Order of definitions,  Next: Delimited definitions,  Prev: Line wide definitions,  Up: Language Definitions

7.4 Order of definitions
========================

It is important to observe that the order of language definitions is
important since it will be used during regular expression matching.
You then have to make sure that, if there are definitions that start
with same characters, the longest expression is specified first in the
file.  For instance if you write

     symbol = "/"
     comment start "//"

   The first expression will always be matched first, and the second
expression will never be matched.  The right order is

     comment start "//"
     symbol = "/"

7.5 Delimited definitions
=========================

Many elements are delimited by specific character sequences.  For
instance, strings and multiline comments.  The syntax for such an
element definition is

     <name> delim <left delimited> <right delimiter> \
             {escape <escape character>} \
             {multiline} {nested}

   The `escape' specification allows to specify the escape character
that may precede one of the delimiters inside the element.  This is
optional.

   For instance, this is the definition of C-like strings:

     string delim "\"" "\"" escape "\\"

   Notice that `\' is a special characters in definitions so it has to
be escaped.  If the `escape' specification was omitted, the C string
`"write \"hello\" string"' would have been highlight incorrectly (it
would have been highlighted as the string `"write \"', the normal
character sequence `hello\' and the string `" string"').

   The option `multiline' specifies that the element can spawn multiple
lines.  For instance, PHP strings are defined as follows:

     string delim "\"" "\"" escape "\\" multiline

   The option `nested' instructs to count possible multiple occurrences
of delimited characters and to match relative multiple occurrences
(using a stack).  For instance, if we wanted to highlight C-like
multiline comments in a nested way(1), we could use the following
definition:

     comment delim "/*" "*/" multiline nested

   If `nested' was not used, then the closing `*/' of the following
nested comment would conclude the comment (and the second `*/' would
not be highlighted as a comment):

     /*
        This is a /* nested comment */
     */

   As said above, definitions are cumulative, and they are also
cumulative even when using different syntactic forms.  Thus, for
instance, the complete definition for C++-style comments are the
following (actually, the definition of C-style comment is more
involved, see the file `c_comment.lang'):

     comment start "//"
     comment delim "/*" "*/" multiline

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) As Ed Kelly correctly pointed out, C-style comments are NOT
nested; it's a big shame I've been using C++ and Java for years and
have always thought they were nested :-)... Thus, in previous versions
of source-highlight distributions, C-style comments were (uncorrectly)
defined as nested.  Thank you Ed, for your feedback!

7.6 Variable definitions
========================

It is possible to define variables to be re-used in many parts in a
language definition file.  A variable is defined by using

   `vardef' <name of the variable> `=' <list of definitions>

   Once defined, a variable can be used by prepending the symbol `$' to
its name.  For instance,

     vardef FUNCTION = '(?:[[:alpha:]]|_)[[:word:]]*[[:blank:]]*(?=\()'
     function = $FUNCTION

   The capital letters are used only for readability.

   It is also possible to concatenate variables and expressions, and
reuse variables inside further variable definitions:

     vardef basic_time = '[[:digit:]]{2}:[[:digit:]]{2}:[[:digit:]]{2}'
     vardef time = '\<' + $basic_time + '\>'


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Dynamic Backreferences,  Next: File inclusion,  Prev: Variable definitions,  Up: Language Definitions

7.7 Dynamic Backreferences
==========================

With _dynamic backreferences_ you can refer to a string matched by the
regular expression of the first element of a `delim' specification(1).
I called these backreferences dynamic in order to distinguish them by
the backreferences of regular expression syntax, *Note Ways of
specifying regular expressions::.  This is crucial in cases when the
rigth delimiter depends on a subexpression matched by the left
delimiter; for instance, Lua comments can be of the shape `--[[ comment
]]' or `--[=[ comment ]=]', but not `--[=[ comment ]]' neither `--[[
comment ]=]' (furthermore, they can be nested)(2).  Thus, the regular
expression of the right element depends on the one of the left element.

   A dynamic backreference is similar to a variable (*Note Variable
definitions::), but there's no declaration, and have the shape of

     @{number}

where `number' is the number of the marked subexpression in the left
delimiter (source-highlight will actually check that such a marked
subexpression exists in the left delimiter).

   For instance, this is the definition of Lua comments (see also
`lua.lang'):

     environment comment delim `--\[(=*)\[` "]" + @{1} + "]"
                 multiline nested begin
       include "url.lang"
       ...
     end

Notice how the left delimiter can match an optional `=', as a marked
subexpression, and the right delimiter refers to that with @{1}.

   Source-highlight will take care of escaping possible special
characters during dynamic backreference substitutions.  For instance,
suppose that you must substitute `|' for @{1}, because we matched `|'
with the subexpression `[^[:alnum:]]' in a delim element like the
following one:

     comment delim `([^[:alnum:]])` @{1}

Since `|' is a special character in regular expression syntax
source-highlight will actually replace `@{1}' with `\|'.

   IMPORTANT: the right delimiter can only refer to subexpressions of
its left delimiter; thus, in case of nested delim element definitions
(e.g., in states or environment, *Note State/Environment
Definitions::), the left delimiter acts as a binder and hides possible
subexpressions defined in outer delim elements.

   (2) I'm grateful to Jurgen Hotzel for rasing this issue about Lua
comments; this led me to introduce dynamic backreferences.

7.8 File inclusion
==================

It is possible to include other language definition files into another
file.  This is inclusion actually physically includes the contents of
the included file into the current file during parsing, at the exact
point of inclusion (just like the `#include' in C/C++).   This is
useful for re-using definitions in many files.   For instance, C++
comment definitions are given in a file `c_comment.lang', and this file
is included in the Java and C++ definition files.  The same happens for
number and functions.  For instance, the file `java.lang' contains the
following include instructions:

     include "c_comment.lang"

     include "number.lang"

     keywords ...

     include "function.lang"

   Notice that the order of inclusion is crucial since the order of
definition is crucial.  If function definition was included before
keyword definitions, then the sentence `if (exp)' would be highlighted
as a function invocation.


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: State/Environment Definitions,  Next: Explicit subexpressions with names,  Prev: File inclusion,  Up: Language Definitions

7.9 State/Environment Definitions
=================================

Sometimes you want some source element to be highlighted only if they
are surrounded by other elements.  Source-highlight language definitions
provides also this feature.

     state|environment <standard definition> begin
       <other definitions>
     end

   This structure is recursive (so other state/environment definitions
can be given within a state/environment).   The meaning of a
state/environment is that the definitions within the `begin ... end'
are matched only if the definitions that define the state/environment
have been matched.  When entering a state/environment, however, the
definitions given outside the state/environment are not matched.  The
difference between `state' and `environment' is that in the latter,
normal parts of the source language (i.e., those that do not match any
definition) are highlighted according to the style of the definition
that defines the environment.

   As an example, the following defines the multiline  nested C comment,
and highlights URL and e-mail addresses only when they appear inside a
comment (notice that this uses file inclusion):

     environment comment delim "/*" "*/" multiline nested begin
           include "url.lang"
     end

   Notice that we used `environment' because everything else inside a
comment has to be formatted according to the comment style.

   While for programming language definitions states/environments can be
avoided (although they allow to highlight some parts only if inside a
specific environment, e.g., URLs inside comments, or documentation tags
in Javadoc comments), they are pretty important for highlighting files
such as logs and ChangeLog files, since elements have to be highlighted
when they appear in a specific position.   For instance, for ChangeLog
(see `changelog.lang'), we use a state for highlighting the date, name,
e-mail or URL (taken from `url.lang'):

     state date start '[[:digit:]]{2,4}-?[[:digit:]]{2}-?[[:digit:]]{2}' begin
       include "url.lang"
       name = '([[:word:]]|[[:punct:]])+'
     end

   Notice that definitions that appear inside a state/environment have
the same scope of the expressions that define the environment.  While
this makes sense for `start' and `delim' definitions, it may makes less
sense for simple definitions (i.e., those that simply lists all
possible expressions): in fact, in this case, such expressions do not
define a scope.  For such definitions, the semantics of
state/environment is that the state/environment starts after matching
one of the alternatives.  And where will it end?   In this case you must
explicitly exit the environment.   For instance, you can say that, when
inside a state/environment, a specific language definition, when
encountered also exits the environment (with the keyword `exit').  You
can even exit all the environments with `exitall'.   For instance, the
following definition, highlights a non empty string following a web
method:

     vardef non_empty = '[^[:blank:]]+'

     state webmethod = "OPTIONS|GET|HEAD|POST|PUT|DELETE",
               "TRACE|CONNECT|PROPFIND|MKCOL|COPY|MOVE|LOCK|UNLOCK" begin
       string = $non_empty exit
     end

   If you ever need such advanced features, you may want to take a look
at the `log.lang' definition file that defines highlighting for several
log files (access logs, Apache logs, etc.).


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Explicit subexpressions with names,  Next: Redefinitions and Substitutions,  Prev: State/Environment Definitions,  Up: Language Definitions

7.10 Explicit subexpressions with names
=======================================

Often, you need to specify two program elements in the same regular
expressions, because they are tightly related, but you also need to
highlight them differently.

   For instance, you might want to highlight the name of a class (or
interface) in a class (or interface) definition (e.g., in Java).  Thus,
you can rely on the preceding `class' keyword which will then be
followed by an identifier.

   A definition such as

     keyword = '(\<(?:class|interface))([[:blank:]]+)([$[:alnum:]]+)'

will not produce a good final result, since the name of the class will
be highlighted as a keyword, which is not what you might have wanted:
for instance, the class name should be highlighted as a `type'.

   Up to version 2.6, the only way to do this was to use state or
environments (*Note State/Environment Definitions::) but this tended to
be quite difficult to write.

   Since version 2.7, you can specify a regular expression with marked
subexpressions and bind each of them to a specific language element (the
regular expression must be enclosed in ``', see *Note Ways of
specifying regular expressions::):

     (elem1,...,elemn) = `(subexp1)(...)(subexpn)`

   Now, with this syntax, we can accomplish our previous goal:

     (keyword,normal,type) =
       `(\<(?:class|interface))([[:blank:]]+)([$[:alnum:]]+)`

This way, the `class' (or `interface') will be highlighted as a
keyword, the separating blank characters are formatted as `normal', and
the name of the class as a `type'.

   Notice that the number of element names must be equal to the number
of subexpressions in the expression; furthermore, at least in the
current version, the expression can contain only marked subexpressions
(no character outside is allowed) and no nested subexpressions are
allowed.

   Thus, the following specifications are NOT correct:

     (keyword,symbol) = `(...)(...)(...)` # number of elements doesn't match
     (keyword,symbol) = `(...(...)...)(...)` # contains nested subexpressions
     (keyword,symbol) = `...(...)...(...)` # outside characters

   This mechanism permits expressing regular expressions for some
situation in a much more compact and probably more readable way.  For
instance, for highlighting ChangeLog parts (the optional `*' as a
symbol, the optional file name and the element specified in parenthesis
as a `file' element, and the rest as `normal') such as

       * src/Makefile.am (source_highlight_SOURCES): correctly include
       changelog_scanner.ll

       * this is a comment without a file name

before version 2.6, we used to use these two language definitions:

     state symbol start '^(?:[[:blank:]]+)\*[[:blank:]]+' begin
       state file start '[^:]+\:' begin
         normal start '.'
       end
     end

     state normal start '^(?:[[:blank:]]+)' begin
       state file start '[^:]+\:' begin
         normal start '.'
       end
     end

which can be hard to read after having written them.  Now, we can write
them more easily (see `changelog.lang'):

     (normal,symbol,normal,file)=
       `(^[[:blank:]]+)(\*)([[:blank:]]+)((?:[^:]+\:)?)`
     (normal,file)= `(^[[:blank:]]+)((?:[^:]+\:)?)`


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Redefinitions and Substitutions,  Next: Notes on regular expressions,  Prev: Explicit subexpressions with names,  Up: Language Definitions

7.11 Redefinitions and Substitutions
====================================

These two features are useful when you want to define a language by
re-using an existing language definition with some changes.  Typically
you `include' another language definition file and you
redefine/substitute some elements.

   When you use `redef' you erase all the previous definitions of that
language elements with the new one.  The new language element
definition will be placed exactly in the point of the new definition.
We use this feature, for instance, when we define the `sml' language by
re-using the `caml' one: they differ only for the keywords(1).  In
fact, the contents of `sml.lang' is summarized as follows:

     include "caml.lang"

     redef keyword = "abstraction|abstype|and|andalso..."

     redef type = "int|byte|boolean|char|long|float|double|short|void"

   Since the new language element definition appears in the exact point
of the redefinition, this means that such a regular expression will be
matched only if all the previous ones (the ones of the included file)
cannot be matched.  This may lead to unwanted results in some cases
(not in the `sml' case though).  In other words the following code

     keyword = "foo"
     keyword = "bar"
     type = "int"
     redef keyword = "myfoo"

is equivalent to the following one

     type = "int"
     keyword = "myfoo"

   If this is not what you want, you can use `subst', which is similar
to `redef' apart from that it replaces the previous first definition of
that language element in the exact point of that first definition (all
other possible definitions are simply erased).  That is to say that the
following code

     keyword = "foo"
     keyword = "bar"
     type = "int"
     subst keyword = "myfoo"

is equivalent to the following one

     keyword = "myfoo"
     type = "int"

   It is up to you to decide which one fits best your needs.  We use
this feature to define `javascript' in terms of `java':

     include "java.lang"

     subst keyword = "abstract|break|case|catch|class|if..."

Here using `redef' would have led to the unwanted behavior that `if
(exp)' would have been highlighted as a function call, since the
function element definition would have come first (and then matched
first) than the redefinition of `if' as a keyword.  Another example is
the language definition for C# by reusing the one for C/C++, *Note
Highlighting C/C++ and C#::.

7.12 Notes on regular expressions
=================================

Although we refer to Boost documentation for such syntax(1), we want to
provide here some explanations of some forms of regular expressions
that might be unknown but that are pretty useful in language
definitions.

   Typically, when you need to group sub-expressions with parenthesis,
but you don't want the parenthesis to spit out another marked
sub-expression,  you can use a _non-marking parenthesis_
`(?:expression)'.  This is not necessary in the language definition
syntax: even though you use standard parenthesis, source-highlight will
transform it into a non-marking parenthesis.

   Source-highlight translates possible _marked subexpressions_, i.e.,
those enclosed in `(' and `)', into non-marked subexpressions (i.e.,
those explained above).  Since version 2.7, if you specify the
expression inside ``' the marked subexpressions are left as such (see
also *Note Ways of specifying regular expressions::).  This is useful
for _backreferences_ and _conditionals_.

   An escape character followed by a digit n, where n is in the range
1-9, is a _backreference_ matches the same string that was matched by
sub-expression n.  For example the expression `^(a*).*\1$' will match
the string: `aaabbaaa' but not the string `aaabba'.  Backreferences are
useful to write compact language elements, such as in the case of
Perl's substitution modifiers; thus

     regexp = `s([^[:alnum:][:blank:]]).*\1.*\1[ixsmogce]*`

   will match all these forms

     s/foo/bar/g
     s|foo|bar|g
     s#foo#bar#g
     s@foo@bar@g

   A useful regular expression form is the _Forward Lookahead Asserts_
that come in two forms, one for positive forward lookahead asserts, and
one for negative lookahead asserts:

`(?=abc)'
     matches zero characters only if they are followed by the expression
     "abc".

`(?!abc)'
     matches zero characters only if they are not followed by the
     expression "abc".

   For instance, in the definition of a function (`function.lang') we
use the following regular expression:

     ([[:alpha:]]|_)[[:word:]]*[[:blank:]]*(?=\()

Thus after the name of a function we test, with the regular expression
`(?=\()' whether an open parenthesis `(' can be matched.  If it can be
matched, however, we leave that part in the input (so that the
parenthesis will not be formatted the same way of a function name).

   Please, be careful when using such regular expression forms: since
part of the input is not actually removed you may end up always
scanning the same input part (thus looping) if you do not write the
regular expressions well.  For instance, consider this language
definition

     state foo = '(?=foo)' begin
       foo = '(?=foo)'
     end

and the following input file:

     hello
     foo
     bar

As soon as we match the word `foo' we leave it in the input and we
enter a state where we try to match the word `foo' still leaving it in
the input.  As you might have guess this will make source-highlight
loop forever.  Probably one might have wanted to write this language
definition:

     state foo = '(?=foo)' begin
       foo = 'foo'
     end

but a cut-and-paste error had its way ;-)

   You can also use _Lookbehind Asserts_:

`(?<=pattern)'
     consumes zero characters, only if pattern could be matched against
     the  characters preceding the current position (pattern must be of
     fixed  length).

`(?<!pattern)'
     consumes zero characters, only if pattern could not be matched
     against the  characters preceding the current position (pattern
     must be of fixed  length).

   Another advanced regular expression mechanism is the one of
_conditional expressions_

`(?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)'
     attempts to match yes-pattern if the condition is true, otherwise
     attempts to match no-pattern.

`(?(condition)yes-pattern)'
     attempts to match yes-pattern if the condition is true, otherwise
     fails.

   Condition may be either a forward lookahead assert, or the index(2)
of a marked sub-expression (the condition becomes true if the
sub-expression has been matched).  For instance, the following
expression(3), that we wrote on more lines to try to make it more
readable

     (?:
       (\()
       |(\[)
       |(\{)
     )
     [[:alpha:]]*
     (?:
       (?(1)
         \)
         |(?:(?(2)
           \]
           |(?:\}
     )))))

   will match `(foo)', `[foo]' and `{foo}' but not `(foo]', `{foo]' or
`{foo)'.

7.13 The program `check-regexp'
===============================

Since version 2.7, the source-highlight package comes with a small
additional program, `check-regexp', that permits testing regular
expressions on the command line.

   You simply pass as the first command line argument the regular
expression and then the strings you want to try to match (actually, the
program searches the string for the given regular expression, so it is
not required to match the whole string).  It is crucial, in order to
avoid shell substitutions, to enclose both the expression and the
strings in single quotes.

   The program then prints some information about the (possibly
successful matching).  The `what[0]' part represents the whole match,
and `what[i]' part represents the i-th marked subexpression that
matched.  The program also prints possible prefix and suffix.

   Here's an example of output of the program:

     check-regexp '(a+)(.*)\1' 'aabcdaa' 'babbbacc'

     searching      : aabcdaa
     for the regexp : (a+)(.*)\1
     what[0]: aabcdaa
       what[1]: aa
       length: 2
       what[2]: bcd
       length: 3
     total number of matches: 1

     searching      : babbbacc
     for the regexp : (a+)(.*)\1
     prefix: b
     what[0]: abbba
       what[1]: a
       length: 1
       what[2]: bbb
       length: 3
     suffix: cc
     total number of matches: 1

   And here's the example of matching parenthesis we saw in *Note Notes
on regular expressions:::

     check-regexp \
        '(?:(\()|(\[)|(\{))[[:alnum:]]*(?:(?(1)\)|(?:(?(2)\]|(?:\})))))' \
        '{ciao}' '(foo]' '[hithere]'

     searching      : {ciao}
     for the regexp : (?:(\()|(\[)|(\{))[[:alnum:]]*(?:(?(1)\)|(?:(?(2)\]|(?:\})))))
     what[0]: {ciao}
       what[3]: {
       length: 1
     total number of matches: 1

     searching      : (foo]
     for the regexp : (?:(\()|(\[)|(\{))[[:alnum:]]*(?:(?(1)\)|(?:(?(2)\]|(?:\})))))
     total number of matches: 0

     searching      : [hithere]
     for the regexp : (?:(\()|(\[)|(\{))[[:alnum:]]*(?:(?(1)\)|(?:(?(2)\]|(?:\})))))
     what[0]: [hithere]
       what[2]: [

7.14 Listing Language Elements
==============================

In order for language definitions to be really useful they must be used
in proper combination with formatting styles (see *Note Output format
style::).  However, these different files might not be developed by the
same person, or simply some one may want to customize one of these.  In
order to define good output formatting style files you should be aware
of each language element defined by a language definition file.
Instead of having to look inside the language definition file itself
(and recursively in each included file) you can use the command line option
`--show-lang-elements'(1), that simply prints to the standard output
all the language elements that can be highlighted with a specific
language definition file.

   For instance, for `cpp.lang' you get:

     cbracket
     comment
     function
     keyword
     named subexps
     number
     preproc
     specialchar
     string
     symbol
     todo
     type
     url

   while for `log.lang' you get:

     cbracket
     comment
     date
     function
     ip
     named subexps
     normal
     number
     string
     symbol
     time
     twonumbers
     webmethod

7.15 Concluding Remarks
=======================

By mixing all these features you can unleash your imagination and define
highlighting for complex source languages such as Flex and Bison by
writing few lines of code and re-use existing ones.  For instance, Flex
and Bison have their own syntax and lets you write C/C++ code in
specific parts of the source language, e.g., the code between  the
outmost brackets, in the following example, is C++ code, and should be
highlighted following C++ language definitions (apart from variables
that are prefixed with `$'):

     globaltags : options { if (...) { setTags( $1 ); } }

   This is easy to do (taken from `flex.lang'):

     state cbracket delim "{" "}" multiline nested begin
       variable = '\$.'
       include "cpp.lang"
     end

   Notice that, since we used `nested' we can be sure that the C++
language definitions are not considered anymore when we matched the
last closing `}'.

7.16 Debugging
==============

When writing a language definition file, it is quite useful to be able
to debug it (by using complex regular expressions one may experience
unwanted behaviors).  Since version 2.1 the command line option
`--debug-lang' is available.  When using this option, some additional
information are printed to the standard output.

   Since version 2.5 this option also accepts the a sub specification
(see *Note Invoking source-highlight::).  When using `dump' (the
default) all the additional information explained below will be dumped
without interaction with the user.  When using `interactive', for each
formatted string the program will stop waiting for a command from the
user.  In this very primordial version of interactive debug, the user
will only have to press `ENTER' to make the program continue until the
next formatted string.  This way, the programmer will have the chance
to step the highlighting of each part of the input file.  Moreover,
when debugging is enabled, no buffering will be performed by the
program, thus each formatted element will be immediately available in
the output.  For instance, you can use the command `tail -f' to see the
modifications on the output file on-the-fly.

   When using this command line option the additional information
produced has the following format:

     <.lang filename>:<line number>: <matched subexpression>
     formatting: <source file string to be formatted>
     entering: <next state's regular expression>
     current state: <next state's regular expression>
     exiting:
     exitingall:

   The lines starting with `entering', `exiting' and `exitingall' are
related to entering a new state/environment and exiting one and all
states/environments (`current state', if shown, comes after `entering'
and prints the same state's regular expression but after the
substitution of dynamic backreferences, *Note Dynamic
Backreferences::).  The first line shows a link to the `.lang'
definition file and the line number, i.e., and the sub-expression that
matched and the line starting with `formatting' shows the source file
string that matched with that expression.  If a line starting with
`formatting' is not preceded by a line with the link to the
sub-expression, it means that no particular regular expression has
matched, and thus the style `normal' will be used to format that string.

   Consider the following (simplified) Java source file:

     01: /*
     02:   This is to demonstrate -debug-lang
     03:   http://www.lorenzobettini.it
     04: */
     05:
     06: package hello;
     07:
     08: public class Hello {
     09:         // just some greetings ;-)  /*
     10:     int i = 10;
     11:     System.out.println("Hello World!");
     12: }

   Now you can debug the `java.lang' file by using the `--debug-lang'
command line option.  And the output is as follows:

     c_comment.lang:15: (/\*)
     formatting: "/*" as comment
     entering: (\*/)|(/\*)|...
     formatting: "" as comment
     formatting: "  This is to demonstrate --debug-lang" as comment
     formatting: "  " as comment
     url.lang:2: ((?:(?:[[:word:]]+://(?:[[:word:]]+[\./\-_]?)+)))
     formatting: "http://www.lorenzobettini.it" as url
     formatting: "" as comment
     c_comment.lang:15: (\*/)
     formatting: "*/" as comment
     exiting 1 level(s): (\<(?:import|package)\>)|(//)|...
     formatting: "" as normal
     formatting: "" as normal
     java.lang:1: (\<(?:import|package)\>)
     formatting: "package" as preproc
     formatting: " hello" as normal
     symbols.lang:1: ((?:~|!|%|\^|\*|\(|\)...
     formatting: ";" as symbol
     ... omissis ...
     c_comment.lang:2: (//)
     formatting: "//" as comment
     entering: (\z)
     formatting: " just some greetings ;-)  /*" as comment
     c_comment.lang:2: (\z)
     formatting: "" as comment
     exiting 1 level(s): (\<(?:import|package)\>)|(//)|...

   This should provide enough information to understand how the regular
expressions are used and how the states/environments are entered and
exited.  Please notice that the sub-expressions that are shown may
differ from the original ones specified in the `.lang' file.  This is
due to the preprocessing that is performed by Source-highlight.
Moreover, some sub-expressions are not defined at all in the `.lang'
file: for instance, this is the case for line wide definitions, i.e.,
those that are defined with the keyword `start', *Note Line wide
definitions::.  The last lines above, showing `entering: (\z)', mean
that we wait to reach the end of a line.

   Another useful feature in debugging is the option `--show-regex'
that shows, on the standard output, the regular expression automaton
that source-highlight creates.

   For instance, consider this language definition
(`comment-show.lang'):

     vardef TODO = '(TODO|FIXME)([:]?)'

     environment comment delim "/**" "*/" multiline nested begin
       type = '@[[:alpha:]]+'
       todo = $TODO
     end

     string delim "<" ">"

     string2 delim "<<" ">>" multiline

If you now execute the following command:

     source-highlight --show-regex=comment-show.lang

you will get, on the standard output, the following output:

      STATE 1
      regexp (/\*\*)|(<(?:[^<>])*>)|(<<)
       0: normal  (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)
       1: comment (/\*\*) (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: 2)
          STATE 2
          regexp (\*/)|(/\*\*)|((?:@[[:alpha:]]+))|((?:(?:TODO|FIXME)(?:[:]?)))
           0: comment  (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)
           1: comment (\*/) (exit level: 1, exit_all: 0, next: none)
           2: comment (/\*\*) (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: 2)
           3: type ((?:@[[:alpha:]]+)) (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)
           4: todo ((?:(?:TODO|FIXME)(?:[:]?))) (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)
       2: string (<(?:[^<>])*>) (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)
       3: string2 (<<) (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: 3)
          STATE 3
          regexp (>>)
           0: string2  (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)
           1: string2 (>>) (exit level: 1, exit_all: 0, next: none)

This shows the states of the regular expression automaton that
source-highlight creates and will use to format an input source.

   Each state is associated a unique number in order to identify them.
Then for each state it shows the regular expression for that state
(typically consisting of some alternatives) and the regular expressions
associated to each element (each alternative of the state).  The first
element (the one numbered with 0) of each state is always the default
style for that state, i.e., the style applied if no regular expression
is matched (in fact it does not have an associated regular expression).
For instance, in the initial state the default style is normal.  Then,
we can see that if we match a `/**' (it is shown as a string with
escaped special characters, `/\*\*') we enter a new state, in this case
the state 2 (`next: 2').  This corresponds to the delimited element
defining a new environment.  The fact that it is actually an
environment and not a state(1) can be seen by the fact that the default
style is the same of the environment itself.  If we match a `*/', i.e.,
the end of the delimited element, we exit one level (`exit level: 1')
meaning that we go back to state 1.  Since the delimited element is
defined as nested, we can notice that in the state 2 we have that if we
match `/**' we simply enter a new instance of state 2 itself.

   The `string' and `string2' show the difference implied by the
`multiline' option: since source-highlight handles a line of input
separately, the first delimited definition can be handled with a single
regular expression while the multiline version cannot.

   Notice that the states/environments are indented so that it's easier
to understand the outer and the inner states.

   Let us now consider a variation of the previous example:

     vardef TODO = '(TODO|FIXME)([:]?)'

     environment comment delim "/**" "*/" multiline nested begin
       type = '@[[:alpha:]]+'
       todo = $TODO
     end

     regexp = `([^[:alnum:]]).*(\1)`

     string delim "<" ">"

     string2 delim "<<" ">>" multiline

     (paren,normal,paren) = `(\[)(.*)(\])`

   and let us see the output of `--show-regex'

      STATE 1
      regexp (/\*\*) (has alternatives)
       0: normal  (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)
       1: comment (/\*\*) (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: 2)
          STATE 2
          regexp (\*/)|(/\*\*)|((?:\@[[:alpha:]]+))|((?:(?:TODO|FIXME)(?:[:]?)))
           0: comment  (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)
           1: comment (\*/) (exit level: 1, exit_all: 0, next: none)
           2: comment (/\*\*) (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: 2)
           3: type ((?:\@[[:alpha:]]+)) (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)
           4: todo ((?:(?:TODO|FIXME)(?:[:]?))) (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)
      STATE 3
      regexp (?:([^[:alnum:]]).*(\1)) (has alternatives)
       0: normal  (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)
       1: regexp (?:([^[:alnum:]]).*(\1)) (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)
      STATE 4
      regexp (<(?:[^<>])*>)|(<<) (has alternatives)
       0: normal  (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)
       1: string (<(?:[^<>])*>) (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)
       2: string2 (<<) (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: 5)
          STATE 5
          regexp (>>)
           0: string2  (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)
           1: string2 (>>) (exit level: 1, exit_all: 0, next: none)
      STATE 6
      regexp (\[)(.*)(\])
       0: normal  (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)
       1: paren (\[)
       2: normal (.*)
       3: paren (\])   (exit level: 0, exit_all: 0, next: none)

   Notice that the main state was split into 4 states (that are still at
the main level), each of one, but the last one, shows `(has
alternatives)'.  Since we used the ``' regular expression (see *Note
Ways of specifying regular expressions::), then, the marked
subexpressions are not translated, and to make backreferences work
correctly we need to separate such regular expression from the other
ones (otherwise the backreference would refer to a wrong
subexpression(2)).

   Source-highlight will try to match all alternatives and will then use
the first one with the smallest prefix (i.e., not matched part) and that
matched the longest part.

   Notice that the split of the state takes place only before and after
the points where expressions specified with ``' are encountered (e.g.,
the `string' and `string2' are not split into two alternatives).

   Finally, notice how the isolated state with subexpressions with names
(see *Note Explicit subexpressions with names::) is shown.  In fact,
although that expressions is made up of different elements, the
expression is matched as a whole; thus the next state and exit level are
shown only once.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Please notice that this concept of state is different from the
concept of "state" of an automaton.

   (2) An alternative could have been to adjust backreferences by
increasing the number; however, backreferences are limited to a number
of 9 and we would have soon run out of numbers.

7.17 Tutorials on Language Definitions
======================================

Now we provide some examples of language definitions.   In the previous
sections we have already provided some code snippets, while here we
provide complete examples of language definitions that are included in
the source-highlight distribution itself.

   In particular we will first show the language definition for the
language definition syntax itself (file `langdef.lang').  This will be
used to highlight the examples of language definitions that we will
show in this section (the highlighting will not be visible if you are
viewing this manual with the `info' command).  Of course, this example
is highlighted itself.

     # this is the language definition for the
     # language definition syntax itself
     comment start "#"

     preproc = "include"

     string delim "\"" "\"" escape "\\" multiline
     regexp delim "'" "'" escape "\\" multiline
     regexp delim "`" "`" escape "\\" multiline

     keyword = "state|environment|begin|end|delim|escape|start",
               "multiline|nested|vardef|exitall|exit",
               "redef|subst|nonsensitive"

     symbol = "=|+|,|(|)"

     vardef ID = '[[:word:]]+'

     variable = '\$' + $ID

     variable = $ID

   The style that is used to highlight these examples in Texinfo is
`texinfo.style' that is shown in *Note Output format style::.  The
language definition for the style syntax (file `style.lang') is even
simpler:

     # this is the language definition for the
     # style definition syntax
     comment start "//"

     string delim "\"" "\"" escape "\\"

     keyword = "bgcolor|purple|orange|brightorange|brightgreen|darkgreen",
               "green|darkred|red|brown|pink|yellow|cyan",
               "black|teal|gray|darkblue|blue",
               "normal|linenum",
               "noref|nf|f|u|i|b"
     keyword = 'bg\:'

     symbol = ",|;"

     variable = '[[:word:]]+'

   Notice that this definition is pretty simple since the language
definition syntax is simple.  In the next examples we will see how to
use more complex features to highlight more complex language syntaxes.

File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Highlighting C/C++ and C#,  Next: Highlighting Diff files,  Prev: Tutorials on Language Definitions,  Up: Tutorials on Language Definitions

7.17.1 Highlighting C/C++ and C#
--------------------------------

This is the language definition for C/C++, included in the file
`cpp.lang':

     # definitions for C/C++
     include "c_comment.lang"

     state preproc start '^[[:blank:]]*#(?:[[:blank:]]*include)' begin
             string delim "<" ">"
             string delim "\"" "\"" escape "\\"
             include "c_comment.lang"
     end

     preproc = '^[[:blank:]]*#([[:blank:]]*[[:word:]]*)'

     include "number.lang"

     include "c_string.lang"

     (keyword,normal,type) =
       `(\<(?:class|struct|typename))([[:blank:]]+)([[:alnum:]]+)`

     keyword = "__asm|__cdecl|__declspec|__export|__far16",
       "__fastcall|__fortran|__import",
       "__pascal|__rtti|__stdcall|_asm|_cdecl",
       "__except|_export|_far16|_fastcall",
       "__finally|_fortran|_import|_pascal|_stdcall|__thread|__try|asm|auto",
       "break|case|catch|cdecl|class|const|const_cast|continue|default|delete",
       "do|dynamic_cast|else|enum|explicit|extern|false|for|friend|goto",
       "if|inline|mutable|namespace|new|operator|pascal|private|protected",
       "public|register|reinterpret_cast|return|sizeof|static|static_cast",
       "struct|switch|template|this|throw|true",
       "try|typedef|typeid|typename|union",
       "using|virtual|volatile|while"

     type = "bool|char|double|float|int|long",
       "short|signed|unsigned|void|wchar_t"

     include "symbols.lang"

     cbracket = "{|}"

     include "function.lang"

Notice that this makes use of lots of `include's since these parts are
reused in other language definitions (e.g., Java has lots of parts that
are in common with C/C++ so we wrote these parts in separate files).
In particular the comments definitions:

     # c_comment.lang

     vardef TODO = '(TODO|FIXME)([:]?)'

     # comments with documentation tags
     environment comment start "///" begin
       include "url.lang"
       include "html.lang"
       type = '@[[:alpha:]]+'
       todo = $TODO
     end

     comment start "//"

     # comments with documentation tags
     environment comment delim "/**" "*/" multiline begin
       include "url.lang"
       include "html.lang"
       type = '@[[:alpha:]]+'
       todo = $TODO
     end

     # standard comments
     environment comment delim "/*" "*/" multiline begin
       include "url.lang"
       todo = $TODO
     end

Here we have the definitions for line-wide comments (`//') and for
multi line comments where we highlight also URL addresses and e-mail
addresses (defined in the file `url.lang' not shown here).  Moreover,
for comments that are used in automatic documentation generation tools
(such as Doxygen or Javadoc), i.e., those that start with `/**' or
`///') we also highlight the complete HTML syntax (defined in the file
`html.lang' not shown here).

   Going back to `cpp.lang' we see that for preprocessor directives
`#include' we use a state definition since in this case the file
included with the `<file>' syntax must be formatted as strings (and
only in this context the `<>' must be considered as strings, anywhere
else they are operators).  Since a state erases definitions defined
outside the state we must include `c_comment.lang' again in order to
highlight comments also in this context(1).  Then we have a definition
of `preproc' that catches all the other preprocessor directives.

   The included file `number.lang' defines the regular expression that
catches number constants (not shown here), then we include the file
`c_string.lang' that define strings (again shared by Java):

     vardef SPECIALCHAR = '\\.'

     environment string delim "\"" "\"" begin
       specialchar = $SPECIALCHAR
     end

     environment string delim "'" "'" begin
       specialchar = $SPECIALCHAR
     end

inside a string we want to highlight in a different way the special
characters (such as, e.g., `\n', `\t', etc.)  and in general escaped
characters, matched by the regular expression ``\\.''.

   Notice then, that we use subexpressions with names (see *Note
Explicit subexpressions with names::) for highlighting the class or
struct as a type (when preceded by `class', `struct' or `typename',
highlighted as a keyword).

   The included file `symbols.lang' defines all the symbols (shared
also by other languages):

     symbol = "~","!","%","^","*","(",")","-","+","=","[",
             "]","\\",":",";",",",".","/","?","&","<",">","\|"

This has nothing interesting but the fact that it shows that the
character `\' and `|' have to be escaped.

   The included file `function.lang' defines the regular expression to
match a function definition or invocation:

     vardef FUNCTION = '([[:alpha:]]|_)[[:word:]]*[[:blank:]]*(?=\()'
     function = $FUNCTION

that shows an example of forward lookahead assert for the opening
parenthesis (see *Note Notes on regular expressions::).  As noted in
*Note File inclusion::, it is crucial that this file is included after
the keyword definition.

   Now that we wrote the language definition for C/C++, writing the one
for C# is straightforward, since we only need to add the keyword
`using' as a preprocessor element, and redefine  (or better,
"substitute", *Note Redefinitions and Substitutions::) the keywords and
types:

     # definitions for C-sharp
     # by S. HEMMI, updated by L. Bettini.
     preproc = "using"

     number = '\<[+-]?((0x[[:xdigit:]]+)|(([[:digit:]]*\.)?[[:digit:]]+([eE][+-]?[[:digit:]]+)?))([FfDdMmUulL]+)?\>'

     include "cpp.lang"

     subst keyword = "abstract|event|new|struct ",
      "as|explicit|null|switch",
      "base|extern|this",
      "false|operator|throw",
      "break|finally|out|true",
      "fixed|override|try",
      "case|params|typeof",
      "catch|for|private",
      "foreach|protected",
      "checked|goto|public|unchecked",
      "class|if|readonly|unsafe",
      "const|implicit|ref",
      "continue|in|return",
      "virtual",
      "default|interface|sealed|volatile",
      "delegate|internal",
      "do|is|sizeof|while",
      "lock|stackalloc",
      "else|static",
      "enum|namespace",
      "get|partial|set",
      "value|where|yield"

     subst type = "bool|byte|sbyte|char|decimal|double",
      "float|int|uint|long|ulong|object",
      "short|ushort|string|void"

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) As a future extension we might think of providing a way, in the
language definition syntax, to define a state/environment that extends
the outer contexts instead of overriding them.

7.17.2 Highlighting Diff files
------------------------------

Now we want to highlight files that are generated by `diff' (typically
used to create patches).  This program can generate outputs in three
different formats (at least at best of my knowledge).

   With the option `-u|--unified' the differences among files are shown
in the same context, for instance (the examples of the diff files shown
here are manually modified so that they can fit in the page width):

     diff -ruP source-highlight-2.1.1/source-highlight.spec ...
     -- source-highlight-2.1.1/source-highlight.spec ...

   Summarizing, we would like to be able to handle all these three
different syntaxes; notice that the first format and the second format
have something conflicting: the first one uses the `---' to indicate
the new version of a file while the second format uses it to indicate
the old version of a file.  Since we want to highlight differently the
old parts and the new parts (this is not visible in the Texinfo
highlighting due to the lack of enhanced formatting features, but it is
visible for instance in HTML output where we use two different colors),
this behavior adds some difficulties.  Of course, we could define three
different language definitions, one for each diff output format.
However, we prefer to handle them all in the same file!

   This is the language definition for diff files:

     # language definition for files created with 'diff'

     # diff created with -u option
     state oldfile = '(?=^[-]{3})' begin
       oldfile start '^[-]{3}'
       oldfile start '^[-]'
       newfile start '^[+]'
       difflines start '^@@'
     end

     # diff created with -c option
     state oldfile = '(?=^[*]{3})' begin
       environment oldfile = '^[*]{3}[[:blank:]]+[[:digit:]]' begin
         normal start '^[[:space:]]'
         newfile = '(?=^[-]{3})' exit
       end
       oldfile start '^[*]{3}'

       environment newfile = '^[-]{3}[[:blank:]]+[[:digit:]]' begin
         normal start '^[[:space:]]'
         newfile = '(?=^[*]{3})' exit
         normal start '^diff' exit
       end
       newfile start '^[-]{3}'
     end

     # otherwise, created without options
     state difflines = '(?=^[[:digit:]])' begin
       difflines start '^[[:digit:]]'
       oldfile start '^[<]'
       newfile start '^[>]'
     end

   Since we can safely assume that when we process a diff file it
contains only information created with the same diff command line
switch, we define three different states that correspond to the three
diff output formats.  Notice that these states are entered with a
simple definition; as noted in *Note State/Environment Definitions::,
this means that no automatic exit means are provided, and since no
explicit exit condition is specified, this means that once one of this
state is entered it will never be exited.  This is consistent with our
goal.  Of course, the expression that makes us enter a state must be
defined correctly, and in particular we first search for an initial
`---' sequence since this is used as the first difference specification
by the `-u|--unified' option, so this is a distinguishing feature to be
used to infer which diff format file we are processing.

   Another interesting thing, is that we use the forward lookahead
assert for the opening parenthesis (see *Note Notes on regular
expressions::), since we only want to see which file format we are
processing.  Once we entered the right state we can define the regular
expressions for the elements of the specific diff file format.

   For the files created with the option `-c|--context' we define two
inner environments, one for the new file part and one for the old file
part (these are delimited by a `---' or `***' and line number
information).  Notice that these are environments, so anything that is
not matched by any expression is formatted according to the style of the
element that defines the environment.  Thus, we provide an expression
for text that must be formatted as normal.  For diff files this
corresponds to a line that start with a space or with `diff' (take a
look at the examples above).  In particular the latter case can take
place only during the new file part.  In both environments we must
define the exit conditions.  In both cases these correspond to the
beginning of the complementary part; also in this case we use forward
lookahead assertions, since we use it only to exit the environment.  The
outer definitions for `oldfile' and `newfile' are used to match the
lines with source file information information.

   The third state, corresponding to the normal diff output format,
should be straightforward by now.

7.17.3 Pseudo semantic analysis
-------------------------------

Source-highlight, by means of regular expressions can only perform
lexical analysis of the input source.  In particular, it is based on the
assumption that the input source is syntactically correct with respect
to the input language.  However, by using the language definition syntax
and by writing the right regular expression it is  possible to simulate
some sort of semantic analysis of the input source.

   For instance, consider the following C (or C++) source file:

     // test special #if 0 treatment

     int main() {
     #if 0 // equivalent to a comment
       int i = 10;
       printf("this should never be executed\n");
       return 1;
     #else
       printf("Hello world!\n");
       return 0;
     #endif

       printf("never reach here!\n");
     }

It is easy to verify that the code between `#if 0' and `#else' will be
never executed (indeed it will not even be compiled).  Thus, we might
want to format it as a comment.

   We then write another language definition file, based on the file
`cpp.lang':

     environment comment start '^[[:blank:]]*#if[[:blank:]]+0' begin
       comment start '^[[:blank:]]*#(else|endif)' exit
     end

     include "cpp.lang"

We intentionally included an error in this first version: we used the
`start' element to start the environment, but such element has the
scope of a single line, thus, it does not have the desired behavior:

     // test special #if 0 treatment

     int main() {
     #if 0 // equivalent to a comment
       int i = 10;
       printf("this should never be executed\n");
       return 1;
     #else
       printf("Hello world!\n");
       return 0;
     #endif

       printf("never reach here!\n");
     }

   A better solution is the following one:

     environment comment = '^[[:blank:]]*#[[:blank:]]*if[[:blank:]]+0' begin
       comment start '^[[:blank:]]*#[[:blank:]]*(else|endif)' exit
     end

     include "cpp.lang"

here we enter the `comment' environment by not using a delimited
element, but simply the regular expression to match `#ifdef 0'.  Then
we exit the environment either when we match an `#else' or a `#endif'.
This seems to work:

     // test special #if 0 treatment

     int main() {
     #if 0 // equivalent to a comment
       int i = 10;
       printf("this should never be executed\n");
       return 1;
     #else
       printf("Hello world!\n");
       return 0;
     #endif

       printf("never reach here!\n");
     }

   However, it does not work if we consider nested `#if...#else'; for
instance consider the following code, formatted with the previous
language definition:

     // test special #if 0 treatment

     int main() {
     #if 0 // equivalent to a comment
       int i = 10;
       printf("this should never be executed\n");
     #  ifdef FOO
       printf("foo\n");
     #     ifndef BAR
       printf("no bar\n");
     #     else
     #     endif
     #  else
       printf("no foo\n");
     #  endif // FOO
       return 1;
     #else
       printf("Hello world!\n");
       return 0;
     #endif

       printf("never reach here!\n");
     }

The problem is that the previous language definition does not consider
nested `#if' and thus, the first time it matches a `#else' or an
`#endif' it exits the `comment' environment.

   We must then take into account possible nested occurrences.  This
can be done by using a delimited element with the `nested' option
(*Note Delimited definitions::):

     # treat the preprocess statement
     #  #if 0
     #    ...
     #  #else
     # as a comment

     environment comment = '^[[:blank:]]*#[[:blank:]]*if[[:blank:]]+0' begin
       comment start '^[[:blank:]]*#[[:blank:]]*else' exit
       comment delim '^[[:blank:]]*#[[:blank:]]*if'
                     '^[[:blank:]]*#[[:blank:]]*endif' multiline nested

     end

     include "cpp.lang"

This time the right block of code is correctly formatted as a comment:

     // test special #if 0 treatment

     int main() {
     #if 0 // equivalent to a comment
       int i = 10;
       printf("this should never be executed\n");
     #  ifdef FOO
       printf("foo\n");
     #     ifndef BAR
       printf("no bar\n");
     #     else
     #     endif
     #  else
       printf("no foo\n");
     #  endif // FOO
       return 1;
     #else
       printf("Hello world!\n");
       return 0;
     #endif

       printf("never reach here!\n");
     }

   Notice that it is crucial to exit the environment even when we match
an `#else' (not only an `#endif', since, this way, we can match again
another `#ifdef 0'; consider, for instance, the following code:

     // test special #if 0 treatment

     int main() {
     #if 0 // equivalent to a comment
       int i = 10;
       printf("this should never be executed\n");
       return 1;
     #else
       printf("Hello world!\n");
     #   if 0 // another one
       return 1;
     #   else
       return 0;
     #   endif
     #endif

       printf("never reach here!\n");
     }

8 Output Language Definitions
*****************************

Since version 2.1 source-highlight uses a specific syntax to specify
output formats (e.g., how to format in HTML, LaTeX, etc.).  Before
version 2.1, in order to add a new output format, many C++ classes had
to be written.  This had the drawback that a new output format could not
be added "dynamically": you had to recompile the whole source-highlight
program.

   Instead, now, an output format is specified in a file, loaded
dynamically, through a (hopefully) simple syntax.  Then, these
definitions are used internally to create, on-the-fly,  text formatters.

   Here, we see such syntax in details, by relying on many examples.
This allows a user to easily modify an existing output format
definition and create a new one.  These files have, typically, extension
`.outlang'.

   Each definition basically associates a text style (such as, e.g.,
bold, italics, colors, etc.)  to the representation of that style into
the output format (such as, e.g., `<b>$text</b>' in HTML).  The
representation is given in `"' and you can use the classic escape
character `\' to use the `"' inside the definition.  If you want to
specify the ASCII code for a character you can do so by specifying the
numeric code in hexadecimal notation preceded by `\x', for an example,
see *Note Style template::.

   If no definition is given for a specific style, e.g., bold, then when
that style is requested during formatting, the text will be formatted as
it is, i.e., the style without the definition is simply ignored.

   Comments can be given by using `#'; the rest of the line is
considered as a comment.

   Files can be included in the same way as for language definitions,
*Note File inclusion::.

   In any case, if a definition for a style is given more than once, the
last definition replaces all the others.

8.1 File extension
==================

With the line:

     extension "<file extension>"

you define the default file extension (without the `.') used to
generate files formatted according to this output format.  This is used
when no output file name is specified; if the file extension is not
included in the `.outlang' is not defined, and no output file name is
specified, an error will occur.

   For instance, this is used in `html_common.outlang':

     extension "html"


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Text styles,  Next: Colors,  Prev: File extension,  Up: Output Language Definitions

8.2 Text styles
===============

These are the text styles that one can define:

     bold
     italics
     underline
     notfixed
     fixed

These, of course, correspond to the ones used to specify the output
format style, *Note Output format style::.

   These definitions, for instance, are from the HTML format definition:

     bold "<b>$text</b>"
     italics "<i>$text</i>"
     underline "<u>$text</u>"

Inside a definition you use the special variable `$text' to specify
where the actual text to be formatted has to be inserted.  For instance,
the definition of `bold' above says that if you need to format the
keyword `class' in bold in HTML, the following text will be generated:
`<b>class</b>'.  This variable is used also when mixing more than one
styles recursively, in particular if you want to format in bold and
italics (i.e, first bold and then italics, or, in other words, the
sequence `i, b' is used in the the output format style file, see *Note
Output format style::), then first the text `class' is substituted for
`$text' into `<b>$text</b>' and then the text `<b>class</b>' will be
substituted for `$text' into `<i>$text</i>', thus obtaining
`<i><b>class</b></i>'.


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Colors,  Next: Anchors and References,  Prev: Text styles,  Up: Output Language Definitions

8.3 Colors
==========

The definition for using colors during formatting requires the
definition for the `color' style

     color "..."

and for the `bgcolor' style(1):

     bgcolor "..."

   This definition concerns only the background color for a specific
highlighted element, i.e., the color specified in the style file with
the prefix `bg:' (see *Note Output format style::) or the property
`background-color' specified in a CSS file passed to `--style-css-file'
(see *Note Output format style using CSS::).  Thus it should not be
confused with the background color of the entire output (i.e., the one
specified using `bgcolor' in a style file or the property
`background-color' of the `body' selector in a CSS).  The background
color for the entire document is explained in *Note Document template::.

   Notice that the background color might not be available for all ouput
formats.   For instance, for HTML we only have:

     color "<font color=\"$style\">$text</font>"

while for XHTML we have:

     color "<span style=\"color: $style\">$text</span>"
     bgcolor "<span style=\"background-color: $style\">$text</span>"

   Apart from the variable `$text' that we already saw, we have also
the variable `$style', that will be replaced with the actual color.

   Source-highlight recognizes a number of color constants, see *Note
Output format style::.

   You then must associate a color constant to the color definition in
the output format, through the `colormap' definition:

     colormap
     "color constant" "color representation"
     "color constant" "color representation"
     ...
     default "default color representation"
     end

   The `default' row (notice the absence of `"') defines the color to
be used in case a color constant is used during formatting, but it is
not defined in the output format.

   For instance, for HTML we have:

     colormap
     "green" "#33CC00"
     "red" "#FF0000"
     "darkred" "#990000"
     "blue" "#0000FF"
     "brown" "#9A1900"
     "pink" "#CC33CC"
     "yellow" "#FFCC00"
     "cyan" "#66FFFF"
     "purple" "#993399"
     "orange" "#FF6600"
     "brightorange" "#FF9900"
     "brightgreen" "#33FF33"
     "darkgreen" "#009900"
     "black" "#000000"
     "teal" "#008080"
     "gray" "#808080"
     "darkblue" "#000080"
     default "#000000"
     end

   If your output format does not handle colors you can simply avoid the
definitions of `color' and `colormap' and Source-highlight will simply
ignore colors.

   The color is applied after applying the other styles, e.g., bold,
italics, etc.

   Thus, by continuing the example of the previous section, suppose you
defined the following output style for keywords:

     keyword blue i, b;

then the `class' text will be replaced to `$text' variable and the
value `#0000FF' to `$style' inside the color definition `<font
color="$style">$text</font>' obtaining `<font
color="#0000FF">class</font>' which will then be replaced to `$text' in
`<b>$text</b>' and so on for italics, finally obtaining

   `<i><b><font color="#0000FF">class</font></b></i>'.

File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Anchors and References,  Next: One style,  Prev: Colors,  Up: Output Language Definitions

8.4 Anchors and References
==========================

When using the command line option `--line-number-ref' (*Note Invoking
source-highlight::) an anchor is generated in the output file for each
line numbering.  The style of the anchor is defined by the definition
`anchor'.  If this is not defined, the option `--line-number-ref' has
no effect.  The `$linenum' variable will be replaced with the line
number, and the `$text' variable with the actual text.

   For instance, for HTML we have

     anchor "<a name=\"$linenum\">$text</a>"

   Since version 2.2 source-highlight can also generate references to
several elements (e.g., variables, class definitions, etc.), *Note
Generating References::.  Also in this case the definition `anchor' is
used; furthermore, the definition of `reference' is required.   In the
definition of `anchor' and `reference', apart from the variable
`$linenum', we also have the variables `$infile' (the name of the
original input file) and `$infilename' (the name of the original input
file without the path) and in the definition of `reference' we also
have the variable `$outfile' (the name of the file where the anchor is).
One can decide how to define an anchor and a reference by using these
two variables.  For instance, for HTML we have

     reference "<a href=\"$outfile#$linenum\">$text</a>"

Notice, that in this case we use the `$outfile' since we actually
generate a link to another (or possibly the same) output file.

   On the contrary, for LaTeX, since we do not generate a "clickable"
reference, we refer to the original input file (we use both
`$infilename' and `$linenum' in both definitions of `anchor' and
`reference'):

     anchor "\label{$infilename:$linenum}$text"
     reference "{\hfill $text $\rightarrow$ $infile:$linenum, \
                page~\pageref{$infilename:$linenum}}"

In particular, we use `$infilename' for generating the `\label' and not
`$infile' because the path symbol would "disturb" LaTeX (while we use
the complete file path in the textual information of the reference).

   This will generate a right aligned reference.  Notice that it is
assumed that when generating references in LaTeX one uses
`--gen-references=postline' or `--gen-references=postdoc' and not
`--gen-references=inline' (*Note Generating References::), since it
makes no sense to generate an inline reference (or at least I would not
know how to generate a nice looking one :-).

   Furthermore, for Texinfo:

     anchor "@anchor{$infilename:$linenum}$text"
     reference "@flushright
     @xref{$infilename:$linenum,$text,$text $infile:$linenum}.
     @end flushright"

Notice that using both `$infilename' (and not `$infile' for the same
reasons) and `$linenum' also in the definition of `anchor' somehow
ensures that there are no duplicate anchors; this is done for LaTeX and
Texinfo but not for HTML because it is assumed that the generated
`.tex' and `.texinfo' file is included directly in a master file, as it
is done in this manual (while, for instance, it is assumed that a
separate HTML file is generated for each source and kept separate).  If
this is not your case you can change the definitions of `anchor' and
`reference' as you see fit.  Some examples of outputs with references
in Texinfo are shown in *Note Examples::.

   Indeed, one can use three more definitions for `reference' that
corresponds to the three arguments that can be passed to
`--gen-references' command line option (*Note Generating References::):
`inline_reference', `postline_reference' and `postdoc_reference'.  If
one of this not defined, then the same definition of `reference' is
used.  Having the possibility of specifying different definitions is
useful for instance in the case of HTML: the same style for an inline
reference is pretty ugly when used also for a postline or postdoc
reference:

     postline_reference "<a href=\"$outfile#$linenum\">$text -> $infile:$linenum</a>"
     postdoc_reference "<a href=\"$outfile#$linenum\">$text -> $infile:$linenum</a>"
     reference "<a href=\"$outfile#$linenum\">$text</a>"


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: One style,  Next: Style template,  Prev: Anchors and References,  Up: Output Language Definitions

8.5 One style
=============

If the output format you are defining does not have a specific style
for bold, italics, ... and for colors you can simply use the definition
`onestyle', where you can use both `$style' and `$text'.  This will be
used for any style (indeed any other definition such as bold, italics,
color will be ignored).  Indeed, in this case, it is assumed that the
style of each source element is defined in a file with its own syntax,
i.e., not with a syntax defined by Source-highlight.  (This is the
case, for instance, of HTML using CSS style sheets.)  Moreover, since
the output format style is not used, during formatting the variable
`$style' will be replaced with the name of the element to highlight
(e.g., `keyword', `comment', etc.).

   For instance, for HTML CSS, we simply have:

     onestyle "<span class=\"$style\">$text</span>"

In fact, HTML CSS relies on style definitions provided in a separate
file (the `.css' file indeed).  Thus, when formatting a `keyword',
e.g., `abstract', we will obtain:

     <span class="keyword">abstract</span>

Of course, the style for `keyword' must be defined in the `.css' file.


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Style template,  Next: Line prefix,  Prev: One style,  Up: Output Language Definitions

8.6 Style template
==================

Some output formats are based on a unique template that where the other
styles are composed; during composition the styles can be separated with
a specific separator:

     styletemplate "..."
     styleseparator "..."

   This is used, for instance, for the ANSI color escape sequence
output format (`esc.outlang'):

     styletemplate "\x1b[$stylem$text\x1b[m"
     styleseparator ";"

     bold "01$style"
     underline "04$style"
     italics "$style"
     color "$style"

Notice that, since more than one style can be mixed into the style
template, `bold', `underline', ... explicitly use the variable `$style'.


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: Line prefix,  Next: String translation,  Prev: Style template,  Up: Output Language Definitions

8.7 Line prefix
===============

This feature allows you to generate a string as the prefix of each
generated line that corresponds to an input line (i.e., this prefix is
not generated for other generated output elements, e.g., the lines in
the header, footer, etc.).

   We use this feature in the LaTeX output (*Note LaTeX output::):

     lineprefix "\mbox{}"

This way each line in the LaTeX output is prefixed with `\mbox{}'(1).

   Another interesting example that uses `lineprefix' is the javadoc
output, see *Note Generating HTML output::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is a sort of trick to insert spaces at the beginning of a
line without using a tabular environment; without the leading `\mbox{}'
these spaces would be ignored.  This is the only way I found to achieve
this, if you have suggestions, please let me know!


File: source-highlight.info,  Node: String translation,  Next: Document template,  Prev: Line prefix,  Up: Output Language Definitions

8.8 String translation
======================

Some character sequences that are in the source file may have a special
meaning in an output format, so they need some preprocessing (e.g.,
escaping them).  You can specify the translation table with:

     translations
     "original sequence" "transformed sequence"
     'regex' "transformed sequence"
     ...
     end

The difference between `"original sequence"' and `'regex''(1) is that
with the former you specify a character sequence that will be matched
literally, apart from special characters such as `\' (which, if needed
to be inserted, must be escaped), `\n' (new line) and `\t' (tab
character).  Instead, with the latter, you can specify a regular
expression (this is basically the same difference between `"' and `''
in language definitions, see *Note Simple definitions::).

   For instance, for HTML, we have the following translation table:

     translations
     "&" "&amp;"
     "<" "&lt;"
     ">" "&gt;"
     end

   For LaTeX, the translation table is a little bit bigger; here we
show only a little part, that shows how to escape special characters
(such as `\'), to translate a new line character and tab character:

     translations
     "<" "$<$"
     ">" "$>$"
     "&" "\\&"
     "\\" "\\textbackslash{}"
     "\n" " \\\\\n"
     " " "\\ "
     "\t" "\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ "
     end

Notice that, since a new character must be translated in LaTeX with
`\\', we have to escape two `\' (i.e., `\\\\') and then we want to
actually insert a new line in the output file `\n'.

   For HTML with not fixed font by default, `html_notfixed.outlang'
(see *Note HTML and XHTML output::), we need two translate two space
sequence (i.e., two adjacent spaces, since in HTML more adjacent spaces
are rendered as only one space(2), while we want them as they are), and
we also need to translate a space starting a new line in the source
(thus we use the regular expression `^ ', enclosed in `''); thus we
have:

     translations
     "\n" "<br>\n"
     "  " "&nbsp; "
     '^ ' "&nbsp;" # a space at the beginning of a line
     "\t" "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "
     end

8.9 Document template
=====================

You can define the document template, i.e., the beginning and the end of
an output file, with

     doctemplate
     "...beginning..."
     "...end..."
     end

   For instance, for HTML we have

     doctemplate
     "<!-- Generator: $additional -->
     $header<pre><tt>"
     "</tt></pre>$footer
     "
     end

Notice that in the end part there is an explicit new line.

   In the definition of the `doctemplate' the following variables can
be used and will be replaced during the output generation:

`$title'
     the value of the title for the output file (e.g., the one passed
     with the `--title' command line option;

`$header'
     the contents of the file specified with the command line option
     `--header';

`$footer'
     the contents of the file specified with the command line option
     `--footer';

`$css'
     the value passed with the command line option `--css';

`$additional'
     other additional information.  Source-highlight replaces this with
     its name and its version.

`$docbgcolor(1)'
     the background color for the output document.  Source-highlight
     replaces this with the value specified in the `bgcolor' of the
     `.style' file (see *Note Output format style::) or in the `body'
     selector of the CSS file passed with `--style-css-file' (see *Note
     Output format style using CSS::).

   For instance, for an HTML document with css, (file `cssdoc.outlang')
we have:

     doctemplate
     "<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN\"
         \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/strict.dtd\">
     <html>
     <head>
     <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\"
     content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">
     <meta name=\"GENERATOR\" content=\"$additional\">
     <title>$title</title>
     <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"$css\" type=\"text/css\">
     </head>
     <body>
     $header<pre><tt>"
     "</tt></pre>
     $footer</body>
     </html>
     "
     end

   For an HTML document with header and footer, (file
`htmldoc.outlang') we have (notice the use of `$docbgcolor'):

     doctemplate
     "<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN\">
     <html>
     <head>
     <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">
     <meta name=\"GENERATOR\" content=\"$additional\">
     <title>$title</title>
     </head>
     <body bgcolor=\"$docbgcolor\">
     $header<pre><tt>"
     "</tt></pre>
     $footer</body>
     </html>
     "
     end

   And for an HTML table output (file `htmltable.outlang'):

     doctemplate
     "<table  BGCOLOR=\"$docbgcolor\" NOSAVE >
     <tr NOSAVE>
     <td NOSAVE>
     <pre><tt>"
     "</tt></pre>
     </td>
     </tr>
     </table>
     "
     end

8.10 Generating HTML output
===========================

As a complete example we show the file `html_common.outlang' which
contains the common definitions for the various HTML output formats
(`html.outlang', `htmldoc.outlang', etc.):

     extension "html"

     bold "<b>$text</b>"
     italics "<i>$text</i>"
     underline "<u>$text</u>"
     color "<font color=\"$style\">$text</font>"
     anchor "<a name=\"$linenum\">$text</a>"
     postline_reference "<a href=\"$outfile#$linenum\">$text -> $infile:$linenum</a>"
     postdoc_reference "<a href=\"$outfile#$linenum\">$text -> $infile:$linenum</a>"
     reference "<a href=\"$outfile#$linenum\">$text</a>"

     colormap
     "green" "#33CC00"
     "red" "#FF0000"
     "darkred" "#990000"
     "blue" "#0000FF"
     "brown" "#9A1900"
     "pink" "#CC33CC"
     "yellow" "#FFCC00"
     "cyan" "#66FFFF"
     "purple" "#993399"
     "orange" "#FF6600"
     "brightorange" "#FF9900"
     "brightgreen" "#33FF33"
     "darkgreen" "#009900"
     "black" "#000000"
     "teal" "#008080"
     "gray" "#808080"
     "darkblue" "#000080"
     default "#000000"
     end

     translations
     "&" "&amp;"
     "<" "&lt;"
     ">" "&gt;"
     end

   Moreover, this file is also used for generating javadoc output:

     include "html_common.outlang"

     doctemplate
     " * <!-- Generated by Source-highlight -->
      * <pre><tt>
     "
     " * </tt></pre>
     "
     end

     lineprefix " * "

     translations
     "*/" "&#42;/" # this avoids the */ to be interpreted as
     # the end of a comment inside a javadoc comment
     end

   The javadoc output format is useful to format code snippets that
have to be included inside a javadoc comment of another Java file(1).
Apart from being formatted nicely in the generated HTML documentation,
this also releases the programmer from escaping specific characters in
the code snippet (i.e., `&', `<' and `>').  Notice also that it also
avoids the sequence `*/' to be interpreted as the closing of the
(javadoc) comment.  For instance, if you write this code:

     /**
      * This is an example of usage
      *
      * <pre><tt>
      * System.out.println("*/");
      * </tt></pre>
      */

The resulting Java code contains a syntax error.  If you use
source-highlight to format the code to insert in a javadoc comment you
will avoid these problems.

   An example of a javadoc generated HTML page containing a code snippet
formatted with source-highlight can be found in the file
`SimpleClass-doc.html' in the documentation directory.

Doxygen comments.

9 Generating References
***********************

Since version 2.2 Source-highlight also produces references to fields,
variables, etc.  In order to do this it relies on the program
_Exuberant Ctags_, by Darren Hiebert, available at
`http://ctags.sourceforge.net'.  Thus, you must install this program if
you want Source-highlight to provide this feature.

   The `ctags' program generates an index (or "tag") file for a variety
of language objects found in file(s).  This allows these items to be
quickly and easily located by a text editor or other utility (as in
this case for Source-highlight).  A "tag" signifies a language object
for which an index entry is available (or, alternatively, the index
entry created for that object)(1).

   This means that Source-highlight is able to generate references for a
specific source language if and only if `ctags' handles such language.
We refer to the command line options of `ctags': `--list-maps' and
`--list-languages' to find out the associations of file extensions and
supported languages.

   Reference generation is enable by using the command line option
`--gen-references' (*Note Invoking source-highlight::).  This option
takes an argument that rules how references will be generated:

`inline'
     a reference pointer will be generated exactly in the same place of
     the specific element.  This is useful in output formats that
     naturally supports links, such as HTML, while it is useless for
     output formats that do not support inline links, such as LaTeX.

`postline'
     if a line of the input source contains elements for which we found
     references, the list of references will be generated right after
     the line (see the examples, *Note Examples::).

`postdoc'
     All the references will be generated after the whole input file
     has been generated.

   There is an exception: when an element has more than one reference
(because a variable is defined in many sources or because a method is
overloaded) then if `inline' is specified, the generation switches to
`postline' for that occurrence.

   When `--gen-references' is specified, Source-highlight first invokes
`ctags'.  The use can customize this call by using the command line
option `--ctags' (*Note Invoking source-highlight::).  In particular,
if one does not want `ctags' to be invoked by Source-highlight (e.g.,
because the tags file has already been generated) then `--ctags' must
be passed an empty string, `""'.  In this case or when the specified
`ctags' command line generates an alternative output tag file (the
default generated file is `tags'), one can specify the exact tag file
with the command line option `--ctags-file'.

   Once the tag file is generated, Source-highlight relies on the
library `readtags' provided by the `ctags' distribution, and included
in the Source-highlight sources.

   Notice that if a program element is formatted according to a style
that has the option `noref' (see *Note Output format style::) then this
element is not considered a tag, and no reference is generated.  This is
the case, for instance, for a `comment' element: each string that is
generated with the `comment' style, since this is declared with the
option `noref', it is not considered a tag (see *Note Examples::).

10 Examples
***********

Here we provide some examples of sources formatted with
Source-highlight using the `-f texinfo' command line option.  Please
keep in mind that the highlighting will not be visible in the Info
file, but only in the printed manual and in the HTML output (well, at
least line numbers are visible everywhere :-).

   The first example is produced by using the command:

     source-highlight -f texinfo -i test.java -o test.java.texinfo -n

   and here's the result

     01: /*

     47:         //System.out.println( "bye bye... :-D" ) ; // see you soon
     48:     }
     49: }

   The second example shows the use of `--gen-references'
functionality.  In particular, the following output is generated with
the command:

     source-highlight -f texinfo -i test.h -o test_ref.h.texinfo -n \
          --gen-references=postline

   and here's the result (notice how the comment line containing the
string `mysum' does not contain references, since it is a `comment'
element, and this element has the option `noref' in the
`texinfo.style', see *Note Output format style::.  The same holds for
the `_TEXTGEN_H' comment in the last comment line).
